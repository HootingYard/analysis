key and it's time for hooting yard on the air. Once again when we have one of those exciting weeks when we don't have the theme music at the beginning, but we do have it maybe later on. It's just you never quite know what's gonna happen. I'm a bit of a mishmash rag bag of a show this week. Just various stuff, really, and I'm going to begin with a piece called Blodgett jihad. Bad Blodgett. One Tuesday in spring, he went a roaming among the perspex caves of Lamont, part of that magnificent artificial coastline immortalized in mezzotints by the mezzotint East Rex tent, sheltering in one of the caves from a sudden downpour. Blodgett took his sketchbook out of his satchel, and pass the time making a series of cartoon drawings of historical figures. The pictures were imaginary likenesses, of course, for Blodgett was ignorant of many things. And he had no idea what blind jack of Knaresborough looked like. nor was he at all sure that his double cartoon of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray bought any resemblance to the stars of Double Indemnity. The rain showed no sign of ceasing. So Blodgett filled page after page, scribbling drawings of Marcus Aurelius, Christopher smart, Christopher Plummer, Mary Baker, Eddy, Percy Bish, and Mary Shelley, and the Prophet Muhammad, among others. It was this last cartoon that caused ructions, which would have so decisive and effect on Blodgett life. Later that day, on his way home from the perspex caves of Lamont Blodgett inadvertently left his sketchbook on the bus. A week or so later, a bus company employee was checking through the last property and took a few moments to leave through the book. Turning the fateful page, this employee, an adherent of the Islamic faith, was by turns outraged, humiliated, mortally offended and infuriated when he saw Blodgett cartoon. As is the way with such matters, he immediately arranged for copies to be distributed to molars and mam's around the world so that they too could share his outrage, humiliation, mortal offense and fury. Soon, there were calls for Blodgett to be beheaded or otherwise put to death, and he went into hiding. To understand what all the fuss was about, maybe you need to look at the cartoon and projects cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed is online at on the hooting yard website, just put hooting yard into Google and it will take you straight there. In an interesting side note, there was a similar flurry of anger from a sect devoted to the cult of Fred MacMurray. But this film fizzled out after Blodgett pledged to attend a penitential screening of one of the actors late pieces of Disney pap. Meanwhile, hiding out in the perspex caves of Lamont, the evil cartoonist had time to think through what had happened. Blodgett was aware that the Victorian atheist Charles bradlaugh, had to describe the Christian gospels as being, quote, concocted by illiterate half starved visionaries in some dark corner of a Greco, Syrian slum, unquote. And he did not think it much of a leap to conclude that the Prophet Mohammed was an equally diluted soul, although perhaps a better organized one with access to weaponry, which enabled him to spread his message faster and more efficiently. Around this time, Blodgett received through an intermediary an offer from the furious and offended Islamised, the sentence of death could be rescinded. They suggested if he made a sincere conversion to their faith, and promised to live out the rest of his life of his. I'm going to begin that sentence again. The sentence of death could be rescinded. They suggested if he made a sincere conversion to their faith, and promised to live out the rest of his days in submission to Allah. Blodgett considered this for about 40 seconds before rejecting it.

Unknown Speaker  04:56
Apart from anything else, he reasoned, it was very unlikely that missing Blodgett would agree to spend the rest of her life cocooned in a person sized tent, and to stop going out by herself. Shortly after this still in hiding, Blodgett had a brainwave. Indeed, he became somewhat furious and offended himself. The conversion offer he decided was an example of the old cliche if you can't beat them join them. Well, he would join them, but not in the way they thought. If half starved, visionaries could propagate the Christian gospels, and Mohammed could claim to have heard the voice of God, as so many others down the centuries had insisted with varying degrees of success, that they were in direct contact with supernatural powers. What was to stop Blodgett announcing that he and only he had found the true path from this spark of inspiration was Blodgett ism born. He began to make clandestine visits to the municipal library at blister lane, devouring among other works, the Quran, the Bible, the collected works of L. Ron Hubbard, and David ik, the Book of Mormon sacred texts from all the major religions and many of the minor ones, even a couple of novels by Ayn Rand. After a few weeks of constant reading, Blodgett set out to define Blodgett ism. He didn't want it to be a synthesis of every other faith, that seemed a little too Pat, a little too blocky esque. And nor did he want it to be simply an amalgam of the good bits, considering that he was still under sentence of death row of a number of shouting men with beards. Blodgett wanted Blodgett ism to be a favored one says rigorous and intransigent as Islam. Thus, he cast aside with reluctance, some of the more amusing things he had learned, such as underwear regulations in Mormonism, and Mr. Hubbard's intergalactic drivel, and fixed his attention on jihad. As far as Jihad as inner struggle was concerned, Blodgett could not give a hoot. But Jihad has holy war appealed to him as a way of taking on his persecutors. And that's became the most important feature of the blog protest religion. Excuse me, while I clear my throat. In the book of Blodgett, published in paperback The following year, it has to be said that the founder of the new religion makes an impeccably reasonable argument in favor of his faith. Having devised a set of laws called the blog jatiya, he announces that it's the duty of everyone on earth to obey them or be killed. taking his cue mainly from the Quran and the Old Testament. Blodgett devised an appropriately illogical and arbitrary set of regulations for human behavior. The list of laws is too long and abstruse to tell you the whole lot here, but a couple of examples will suffice. The blog jatiya law number 12. Thou shalt not eat plums within 10 yards of a pig or a goat or a Starling. Those that disobey this law will be bundled up in sacking and thrown into a canal. The blog jatiya law number 49. It is forbidden to wear your hat at other than a jaunty angle. See appendix for diagrams of angles of jaundice and non jaundice. officials of the committee for the promotion of blog jetty and virtue and the whole sales suppression of blog jetty and vice and abomination armed with protractors and tape measures will fan out across the land, and where they find hats worn at non jaunty angles. They shall proceed to poke the malefactor with pointy sticks before putting them to an entirely justifiable

Unknown Speaker  09:16
death. Of course, the prophet Mohammed was able to spread his word through a combination of historical and geographic circumstance and violence. Alas, Blodgett ism, never really took root, numbering, perhaps only three or four devotees at its height, including Blodgett himself, but there are a few copies of the book of Blodgett which have not been pulped or thrown into dust bins, and they may yet inspire a new generation of fanatical adherence, who will demand in big shouty voices that they are right and everyone else is wrong and get very upset and angry if you disagree with them and it will be your fault. If they Decide to blow you up or chop off your head. Be warned. So that was that was related, I suppose in some way to Islam. And now something about Christianity. There is a theme developing. It's not just a rag bag is it? Anyway, it's become fashionable among pious young Christian folk, particularly in the United States to wear wristbands bearing the letters, w w. j. d. This simple formula announces that the wearer has devoted their life to Christ and faces any and all situations by asking the question, What would Jesus do? Leaving aside the objection that the daily challenges faced by a mystic Carpenter in Palestine 2000 years ago, may not be wholly applicable to the kinds of issues facing a young person hanging around a mall in Poughkeepsie in the 21st century. I think there's much to be said for this approach. If nothing else, it must lead to some interesting behavior. For one thing, Jesus had a tendency to perform miraculous feats, such as walking on water, or distributing improbable amounts of bread and fish. Sorry, yep. hangover of a cold. I'm still coughing a bit. I'll go back to the beginning of that paragraph. For one thing, Jesus had a tendency to perform miraculous feats, such as walking on water, or distributing improbable amounts of bread and fish. Then there were his occasional temperamental outbursts, as when he showed a gang of moneylenders out of a temple. It's to be hoped that the pious teenies emulate this kind of thing, rather than Jesus rather, priggish sermonizing, for which we had a weakness. Although there are one or two nuggets of wisdom in his preaching, more often it's reminiscent of the airy New Age twaddle might one might get from Deepak Chopra and his ilk. The difficulty remains though, that a contemporary teenager is going to face circumstances that Jesus simply never had to deal with all those years ago. Nowadays, the average young American Christian doesn't spend much time involved with oxen, say or fatted calves, much less with tears and talents and the blood of the Lamb. Young Tad or Biff is likely to get more het up about sodapop baseball caps and stadium rock. Working out what Jesus would do. That's becomes a very fraught endeavor. hours upon hours of biblical study will go some way to resolving the problems. But sooner or later, the morally anguished teen will resort to booze and drugs and firearms. Here at hooting yard, we've come up with an elegant solution to these modern dilemmas, will soon be unleashing on the market wristbands bearing the legend ww DD. What would Dobson do? And of course, there's a simple beauty to this in the sense that whatever the situation, the answer is always write a pamphlet

Unknown Speaker  13:57
out of print. I've just realized with the next piece being called the agony in the garden. That definitely does seem to be a female agony in the garden, of course, one of the climactic moments of the New Testament, and this is called the agony in the garden.

Unknown Speaker  14:40
Not the New Testament version. There was a man in my back garden and he was in agony.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
I'm going to tell you why. This man had speared his foot with a garden fork. One of the very sharp tines of the fork could plunge through his boot and sock and foot and More sock and the sole of the boot and into the muck, forced downwards by the man's other foot, or rather by the muscular power of his leg bent at the knee. He was wearing a pair of Butcher's trousers this man, but he was not a butcher. He was a clumsy thief, inexperienced in the use of gardening implements. It was the middle of the night, and there was no moon, or I should say the moon was hidden by monstrous black clouds, so it was very, very dark. Nonetheless, one would have thought the thief who clambered over the fence to steal things from my back garden would have carried a torch or some other means of illuminating his criminal intent. But not only was he a clumsy thief, he was a thief who lacked foresight. Because the day was still liked when he set out from the heart or near do wells where he lived. He seems to have assumed it would still be light when he approached the wooden fence which divides my back garden from the old muddy lane, but it was no longer light. I live so far away from the hot Oh ne'er do wells that it took him hours and hours to reach my garden. His route was crooked and even convoluted, for he hugged the head roads and dad not stride across open field, nor follow main roads, and nor does he risk using any of the public transport systems available. The pneumatic railways or the canal barges for example, for being bent on crime, he did not wish to be seen. He may have been clumsy and lacking in foresight, but the man in my back garden whose foot was impaled by a fork was a master of stealth. I will give him that. In all the hours he sculpt across the land. In his book his trousers and pastry makers jacket and Dusty Springfield hat. He was not seen by a single other living being, except for some cows in a field, and a passing goat, and attentive birds, and countless tiny things that creep and fly and hover and bows. But none of these can speak unlike human beings, who had they seen the thief might have denounced him to the police. For all his stealth, however, and irrespective of the CAC handedness of his folk digging, the clumsy thieves crime would never have succeeded. He had not made rigorous plans. had he done so he would have learned that I am a detective whose tenacity in crack tracking down malefactors is legendary. One of the things that makes me so good at my job is the fact that I never sleep as a child at a fairground. On a hot September day, I toppled from the top of a Helter Skelter and landed on my head. I have never since then visited the land of nod. The metal plate in my skull is barely visible. And it's been one of the incidental pleasures of my life to a massive collection of strikingly colorful AIPAC trees. So it was that in the middle of the night, when all sensible people are fast asleep in their beds, I was wide awake. I can't remember what I was doing darling an eyepatch or sharpening a pencil perhaps, or carrying out experiments on a badger. When I heard the telltale sounds of a wrongdoer climbing over the fence from the old muddy lane, I went over to the window. My working eye is a superb mechanism. And I watched as in pitch darkness, the thief grabbed the fork from the pile of forks searched the lawn for the big chalk x underneath which was buried the booty of the blister line bank robberies, and with his very first fork thrust, speared his foot and how I promised to tell you how they came to be a man in my back garden, a man in agony. And now I have done so.

Unknown Speaker  19:09
And you can't say fairer than that. Regular listeners will know that. One of my favorite books or pamphlets and this is a genuine pamphlet is further science by Norman Davis. I've only got a copy, a very lovely little pamphlet. I've only got further science book 20, published by Norman Davis in 2001. And annoyingly it contains no other information. Nowhere to contact Mr. Davis and every now and then on this show, I read a little section from it and maybe one day Norman Davis will listen and hear it and get in touch with me. Here's the it's difficult to summarize the content of this pamphlet, so I'll just read the section called Alaskan birds. One, that analysis of Alaskan birds gives insight into bird evolution. To that vast there is a contrast between the cliff ancestral gregarious pigeon type bill knob, fast pulse de Puffin billing, fish eating, borrowing and the night lonesome shrimp squid eating sticky oil swallow like nest burrowing, x pigeon bill knob petrels, thin wing, very slow pulsed long ocean migration, petrels, clearly polarization extremes of x cliff, ancestral pigeons, etc. More about Blodgett now, pre or post Jihad I'm not entirely sure. Through clenched teeth in the municipal yet verdant Parkland, sprawled on grass. Blodgett recited the alphabet. I is for vinegar, he grunted. B is for worms. C is for villains swinging from the gallows. A little voice inside Blodgett had told him to stop. He knew he got it wrong again. He rolled himself down the gentle incline of the grass until he came to rest. Then he sat up and picked flecks of plant life out of his hair. The sun was shining, but the park was almost deserted. He peered across the green towards the truck ice tent and licked his lips. Would he splash out on a truck ice. Blodgett fumbled in his pockets for change, but they were empty. He wondered if there was anybody in charge of the truck eyes tent. Perhaps it too was deserted, and the truck ices were there for the taking. It was more likely that there would be some kind of automatic truck ice dispenser. But Blodgett knew he could jimmied open with his Jimmy. He recalled that he has left his Jimmy at home in a cupboard with his empty yo hort cartons. Blodgett always pronounced yogurt as yo hort. He was that kind of guy. He lay down again and close his eyes and clenched his teeth and made yet another attempt at the alphabet. I is for spinach. B is for the wild life of the Great Lakes.

Unknown Speaker  23:50
C is for pol pot. It was no use. clambering his feet. Blodgett ran across the green to the paddling pool. Though it was the height of summer the pool had been drained. All the water had been collected in a sort of giant concrete bath located a few feet below ground, inaccessible to anyone who was not employed by the municipal Park authorities. Had Blodgett known that several Park keepers were at that very moment enjoying frolics in the subterranean pool, he would have become angry, and had he become angry, he would have tilted his head up and stared boldly at the sun and let for the stream of extra creations, and the sun would have shriveled up and died. Such was the force of Blodgett in human rage. But Blodgett did not know about the underground paddling pool, nor of the antics taking place down there. So this son was safe. He turned away and headed for the gate in the fence. He had decided to go to the docks to watch the arrival and departure of gigantic containers. ships. It was Wednesday, and he was sure to see big boxes of bananas and bales of flax. Listeners in the United Kingdom will know that the Met Office shipping forecast, broadcast on BBC Radio four times a day to an audience composed mainly of land lovers ignorant of its meaning. It's one of our national treasures.

Unknown Speaker  26:03
Overseas listeners who have no idea what I'm talking about when I talk about the shipping forecast, can read a very splendidly detailed entry in the Wikipedia. A great part of the charm, of course, is those wonderful names. Cromartie daga, German bite and it struck me that an equally delightful list is to be found in the stations on the dock clams Light Railway in London. And so I'm helpfully providing today's DLR forecast. Shadwell pining locusts bandage paste 5712 Poplar, clattering Morden starlings catafalque 622 West india quay, flapping dirigible Marmite at 298 Canary Wharf, galumphing peanuts, macadamia nuts 610 Heron keys pinging and grinding Coathanger pot 5211 mudchute looming pagans whirling things 1414.

Unknown Speaker  28:41
And that's the end of this week's show. I'm afraid to say. Hopefully by the time I'm back next week, I won't be coughing up every five minutes. But I do hope you've enjoyed the show. And yeah, that's it for this week. Bye bye.
