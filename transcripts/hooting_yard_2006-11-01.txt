Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. I haven't been here for a few weeks, but now I'm back and here's a rag bag of stuff for the next half hour, instructive and morally uplifting prose as ever, is there anything more important in the early days of November than de worming your goat? If you're a pig fixated person, you may wish to defer. But most if not all, hooting yard listeners will want to ensure that their goats innocent of worms in this critical month in the Capra hircus lifecycle. here then are some useful tips. Listen to them carefully making notes on a scrap of paper as appropriate. For you will want to refer to the tips once you have ranged across the field in your big leaking boots to the goat cubicles. If possible, always weigh your goat before de worming it. Use any old scales you can lay your hands on, but preferably ones in which a goat will squat happily for a minute or two. When you have weighed your goat, you will be able to calculate and inject or drench the correct dosage of the de wormer if you underdose your goat because of failure to weigh it, or because you fecklessly underestimate just how bulky or indeed and bulky it is, this may be a costly mistake. It may lead to your goat developing that most fearsome of conditions, there's parasite resistance to D wormers. But don't rest on your laurels like a smug goat person, because an overdose of certain proprietary d wormers can cause health problems. If not for your goat, then for you and your immediate family and the neighbors up in the big black house on the hill. All sorts of hideous running sores, boils and separations can occur if you overdose your goat, although I'm not quite sure how that happens in a strictly scientific sense. Nevertheless, you don't want to upset those eerie lantern jawed neighbors of yours after what happened in march up in the hills during a thunderstorm with all that eldritch inhuman howling. Do you

having de wormed your goat having day one your goat? You may want to consider that you may need a basin during the during the operation.

Unknown Speaker  03:27
I've long been promising a definitive series of articles on basins and I'm well aware that listeners are champing at the bit. Is there anything else other than a bit which one champs? I wish Dobson had written a pamphlet listing other items suitable for champing at but alas, he never did, to my knowledge. Even had he done so it would be out of print, and I'd have the devil of a job tracking it down. By the way, word reaches me that a complete listing of every single Dobson pamphlet ever written has been posted on the internet. But I haven't been able to track that down. Google gives about two and a half million pages for Dobson and nearly 20,000 for Dobson plus pamphlet and finding time to look at that amount of information disease my tiny curdled brain I'm afraid it would help if we knew Dobson's first name of course, but I'm not sure that he had one. Allah wishes nesting bird one spent a whole winter trying to find out if Dobson's parents ever called him anything except Dobson. He was working from the question or bowl premise that everyone has a first name, and as a result, his health was ruined. They took him to a hospital in a wheelbarrow because he was unable to walk and the ambulance persons were unable to get a stretcher into the hayloft where the scholar was holed up. He taken refuge there, covered in straw, as the newest scenic fits brought on by overwork became more pronounced nesting birds mental state was always fragile, as were his shin bones. As a youth he been an enthusiastic even competent player of hockey, ice hockey, Water Polo, and other games involving hefty wooden sticks capable when wielded with sufficient force of smashing his bones to bits, as they did regularly. It is a bitter irony, he wrote that I acquired a second name being known as Aloysius splinter bones, where I was unable to ever find just the one name for Dobson. Of course, splinter bones was not the only nickname that nesting bird picked up in a career that spanned more decades than I can recall with certainty. Whereas the provenance of splinter bones is easily explained. Some of the others are mysterious, while yet others are highly mysterious. Why, for example, did a little gang of infant band dity who roamed the canal towpath always refer to nesting birders tab hunter when he bore no resemblance to that celebrated actor? We do not know. I haven't forgotten that you're chomping at the bit for an essay about basins. It would have been written by now had I not received a letter from a listener asking a deceptively simple question. Dear Mr. Key, wrote someone signing himself Krista Berg. That's b u r. h g. Dear Mr. Key he wrote, when you write your long awaited and no doubt superb piece about basins, will you be addressing the related issue of sieves? After all, surely a sieve is just a basin with holes in it. As soon as I read this, I rent my garments and let out a shrill cry, like the wild boy of every wrong. My dejection was immense. I picked up a handful of pebbles and hold them through the open window at the crows perched on the fence. Then I picked up another handful of pebbles, bigger ones, and threw them at the starlings on the lawn. I knew that both the crows and the starlings would take their revenge later, by packing my upholstery and my towels. But the business with the pebbles relieve the pressure on my brain and lifted my spirit, albeit temporarily. I went and washed my hair with an exciting new shower product, then sat down and fired off a reply to my correspondent. Dear Mr. deburr hug I wrote, you may think you've asked a simple question by raising the issue of saves as nothing but basins with holes in them, but their simplicity is deceptive. I will now have to rewrite the piece from scratch. so distraught was I on reading your letter that I rent my government let out a shrill cry threw pebbles at crows and starlings and washed my hair which is still dripping wet. My brain is now calm enough for me to put pencil to paper. I'm going to tear up everything I have written about basins and begin again. I signed the letter with wild stabbing thrusts of the pencil burst into tears and became all floppy, like a rag doll neglected and abandoned by the side of a hateful pond.

Unknown Speaker  09:16
I was reading some moral fables the other day, you know, like Aesop's Fables. So I thought I'd write one myself. This is the story of the lame dog, the caged bird, the drowned cat, the gold watch the whiskey boy and the insane boy. Once upon a time, there was an insane boy who could only be becalmed by listening to prog rock. On Monday, about play James harvest album was played to him. On Tuesday, there was a power cut, and in his mania, the insane boy went out and attacked a lame dog. The dog's name was Whoo boo boo. It was a winter ghost dog. On Wednesday, electricity was restored and the insane boy listened to over and over again to pantalla girls Nativity by gentle giant. On Thursday, the insane boy absconded from his deep dark, dank cellar and headed for the hills. With one swift inhuman movement, he plucked a Starling from the sky and put it in a birdcage. On Friday, his keepers forced the insane boy to listen to atomic rooster at an almost imperceptible volume. On Saturday, the insane boy took advantage of a moment in attention on the part of his gods to drown a cat in a puddle. The cat was called fad Fahd flap, and it was 14 years old. On Sunday, Carl Palmer of Emerson lake and Palmer visited the insane boy and played a drum solo that lasted all day. On Monday, the insane boy smashed a gold watch into 1000 bits with his terrifyingly pale fists. On Tuesday, the insane boy had an iPod with only one track clamped to his head, for song was a plague of lighthouse keepers by Van de Graaff generator. On Wednesday, the insane boy managed to smuggle a bottle of spirits into his filthy cell. The Warriors wrote a report for Captain Jarvis, in which they called the insane boy for whiskey boy in accurately as the bottle contained terps. On Thursday, the insane boy begged to hear tales of topographic oceans by Yes. On Friday, the insane boy was pronounced incurable. That story was in words of more than one syllable. It has no moral

Unknown Speaker  12:48
and from the insane boy to the insane route. The insane route is a novel by Mrs. Campbell pride. And here is a quotation from that novel. There lay exposed a strange little brown image, a root of the potato species distorted into human shape. With grotesquely human features, nose lips, the indication of eyes and hairy filaments falling from the sides of the head and forming a kind of beard upon the shriveled jaw and chin. The creature appeared a distinct miniature effigy of a man, the shape of the limbs was clearly traceable, and two little brown tentacles of arms with rudimentary hands lay one by the side, and the other half over the breast. bits of the earth, from which it had been torn, still clung in the indentations of the shape, and on the top of the head, mingling with the tuft of hair with a shriveled remains of a stalk which had been removed or had molded away. Merrily a examine the thing with intense curiosity at the same time revolted by its Quasar human appearance. I think that the insane route which Mrs. Campbell pride refers to in that quotation is likely to be a Mandrake the bifurcated root of the plant resembles a human figure. Also people have thought throughout the ages. There is a legend that when the Mandrake person is pulled from the ground, it shrieks in pain, and this cry is able to mad and death, or even kill an unprotected human being. One way of pulling a Mandrake out of the ground safely is given as follows. A Pharaoh must be dug around the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavors to follow Him and so easily pulls up the route, but dies suddenly instead of his master after this The route can be handled without fear. Being a miniature person, the Mandrake root is that's a type of home monk killers. The first home, mcgillis was made by that old rascal paracelsus out of a bag of bones, sperm, skin fragments and animal hair. These ingredients laid in the ground surrounded by horse manure for 40 days, at which point the embryo formed. It seems likely that paracelsus was making this up. As I tried it. I was looking forward to having a little hub monkey Lois running about the place and was even thinking of a suitable name for it. But when I dug up the patch of manure, there was no sign of any such being the Mandrake itself features in another home musculus recipe. The route has to be picked before dawn on a Friday morning by a black dog, then Washington fed with milk, honey and blood. I was going to try this approach to but I was unable to find a suitable dog. A particularly thrilling method of creating a homerun killers was given by Dr. David Christiana of geisen. In the 18th century, he suggested taking an egg laid by a black hen, poking a tiny hole through the shell, replacing a beam sized portion of the white with human sperm, sealing the opening with Virgin parchment and burying the egg and dung on the first day of the march lunar cycle. Do this, he confidently announced and after 30 days, a miniature humanoid would emerge, which would help and protect its creator in return for a steady diet of lavender seeds and earthworms. Well, I'm gonna have a bash at this method next March, and I'll let listeners know how I get on.

Unknown Speaker  17:31
Here's a story for children. This is called an outing. Listen tiny ones. If you're good, I will take you on an outing. I will take you to the old balsa wood factory on the edge of the Big Blue Lake. Every Thursday afternoon at two o'clock, there is a tour of the factory, especially for Tots for Hooters sound, and everyone lines up at a kiosk in the carpark and Mr. verdigris appears in his towering hat with bells on his sleeves and ribbons and bunting and hamsters nestling in his pockets. And he takes the lucky people, the one with tickets on a tour of the factory. I was sent some tickets in the post yesterday as a special treat. I know that Tim the radio meteorologist says that Thursday will be a day of driving rain and howling gales and I know that it will be the fourth day of our fast and we will be famished but I'm determined that we go. The alternative is that we spend yet another afternoon trying to tell the wild goats and I'm not sure I can take much more of that. So the balsa wood factory it will be

Unknown Speaker  18:49
first there was the grass verge of the carpark and then along some derelict outbuildings including a shared wearing rotted the remains of the hand janitor, and then the factory itself. Its cavernous interior lit by 1000s upon 1000s of gas jets, an eerily silent sofa the occasional buzzing of a saw or the distant insistent pounding of a pulper from the annex over beyond the railway tracks, a sound born in on the wind. After that, the metal Stairway to the offices always deserted on Thursday afternoons, even tiny shoes making the floorboards creak and shelves upon shelves stacked with Higgledy Piggledy piles of files and papers and dockets. And Mr. verdigris took the hamsters from his pockets and place them on a bed of straw next to an important looking desk. It's surface polish to such a gleam as left the children dumbfounded and resting on it. Nothing but a fat new fountain pen and the biggest bottle of ink you could imagine, and the pen had never been used, and the bottle never opened for the lids of both would jammed by dint of mischievous sprites that scampered in the rafters overhead I think was up to the rafters now, up to the attic, past boxes and crates filled with rusty and inexplicable machines, redundant cash registers and forgotten magnetic recording devices through a narrow corridor littered with broken brooms and host to a mysterious gurgling noise until we reached the chamber the end and our tour guide in his towering hat, kicked open the door so violently, and we entered a room lit in a blue, blue glow like heaven, and there in the corner, sprawled on a divan, we saw Pinocchio dexterously plucking flies out of the blue air with his tiny fingers, and biting the tiny head of each tiny fly with his tiny wooden teeth.

So you want to become a hero specs. If you're interested in becoming a hero specs, the first thing to do is choose a sacrificial victim and slaughter it. Or if you're squeamish, have it slaughtered for you. It might be a duck or a hand or a hare. And if you're having delusions of grandeur, you can always use a larger animal like a performing seal or a giraffe. Heru species tends not to engage in human sacrifice, and it's well not to give the police any pretext to investigate your doings. In current law, there is no play of haruspex dumb to defend you against a murder rap.

Unknown Speaker  22:22
Remember that it's important. Now, once the victim has been slain, it's your job to interpret the end trails you will be following in a long tradition. Back in ancient Etruscan times, the earliest heroux species learn their art from cages are being who suddenly sprang from the ground near tarquini.

Unknown Speaker  22:46
Teenagers always claimed to be the grandson of Jupiter. And as no one ever challenged him on this, it must have been so actually, I think he's probably pronounced Tigers rather than take ages. I know what you're going to ask. Victim killed check, splattered with Gore, check, disposition of em trails visible check, but how to interpret them? Well, that's where your local library comes in. Early Harris Percy's sometimes known as x this, Percy's wrote a series of instructional manuals called Liberty how to speak Genie full glaze and tonic through our lives and copies should be available. If you ask the librarian in a very quiet voice, making sure you maintain eye contact. Bear in mind that municipal librarians become rightly suspicious of blood splattered and shifty eyed borrowers. And if that means fixing them with a stare of unhinged mad capillary,

Unknown Speaker  23:49
so be it. These ancient tomes are not forbidden, as far as I know, and you have every right to borrow them unless you owe outstanding fines. I should have told you to get copies of the heroes bezzina manuals before slaughtering your eel or bat or whatever

Unknown Speaker  24:08
creature you selected, sorry. Anyway, by consulting the books you will be well placed to interpret from the fresh end trails, the will of the gods and that's all there is to it. If you're a vegetarian or a vegan, you can still qualify as a herro specs by issuing end trails, and instead interpreter interpreting pour tenter. That is lightning, earthquakes and all extraordinary phenomena in nature. Unlike those snotty nosed augers with their professional association, Harris Percy's tend to be self employed. You can drum up business by advertising in the yellow pages or placing a notice in your newsagents or post office window. Good luck and with a bit of luck, you will be able to join rock Marie F of Swanage, who wrote in to say, I followed the so you want to become a Heru specs course. And I now employ eight people and take three elektrischen holidays every year.

Unknown Speaker  25:41
Regular listeners will know that I very rarely read poetry on on hooting out on the air. But every now and then I do. And this is an old favorite very old actually can't remember how old this is. But it's called docking hack. And it's, I think you need to listen very carefully because there is a deep profundity to this which so maybe you want to kind of copy it down in shorthand while I read it. Or you can look it up on the heating yard website. Just put hooting yard into Google. and off you go. hats are off in docking caps are being doffed. The Council's got a town plan, the maths are on a chart pips have been spat out and drudgery is by bide chocolate puddings seem to be in everybody's pantry. And here comes traitor bill, he caught a shark in waters. His Southwest has been askew since 1954 ish. Bubbles surged from froth the chemist shop is shot. There's pills and pills and pills that no docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted the council in a caucus. The shaven heads of heads of state are battering The Doors Down the city gates, the turrets, the alleys roads and Muse docking has it is all go for Red Alert decisions. language has been no node, the bamboo man or wailing the breakage rate is sheduled. The system has been broken. crayons pink and stacked. The Burnt Sienna packaged vandals clash at nightfall but docking has its crackers. Plastic wrapped in plastic the docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar, a gorgeous snag to Babel, prepared to dancer who cha not a tear or boohoo 1000s of museums stacked with golden maps misshapen trunk road closures, big stone reconstructions dockings cottoned on it's a town about a tower. The frame is out of kilter the coffins filling coffins. Oh, but I want to go back to that docking docking hack.

finalists that fight about hasard again, finally this week, it's come to my attention not that not a single one of the novels by Dorothy sleet, featuring her fictional detective Rex shroud, honorary sleuth is still in print. This is all the more puzzling when one learns that the Broadway show based on the books is breaking box office records. The plot of Arry sleuth the musical cobbles together incidents from the first three novels with certain episodes from Dorothy sleeter life. Like Agatha Christie she wants disappeared for a few weeks and was found in a seaside boarding house. Like out of Hitler. She took seven sugars in her tea. Like the wild boy of every wrong she shrieked when her potatoes were taken away. Like James Joyce, she hid underneath tables during thunderstorms. Like William Ewart Gladstone, she adjust from the works of Homer that all Ancient Greeks were colorblind. Like Pope Pius the 12th, she gave lectures on gas central heating, like Henry Lamar, she made a decisive scientific contribution that helped to win the Second World War. And like Alfred Hitchcock, she was frightened of eggs. It is this last point that explains perhaps the scene in Act Two of the musical where Rex shroud the oratory sleuth finds himself trapped in a little shed completely surrounded by hens. The menacing atmosphere is heightened by the music, a slow brooding theme on woodwinds accompanied by the chorus delivering a dirge about feathers brilliantly the scene segues into a tap dancing extravaganza and the show's hit number. I am an arare sleuth, encircled by hens, which is of course a nod to chapter 16 of Antarctic death paste the second novel in the series. Tickets for the show are hard to get and change hands for ridiculous prices on the Arry sleuth Bay website. animal rights activists should note that none of the hands which appear in the musical is a real bird. Some of them are electronic robots. Some are made of plasticine, and the ones nearest the front of the stage, a construct of sponge and wire and string. And that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. And I'll be back with even more stuff like this next week. Bye bye
