Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Half an hour of prose as usual. Those of you who are keen readers of the hooting yard website will have noticed that it hasn't been updated for almost two months now, which is extremely bad news. The reason for this is what we doctors call writer's block. However, I have been working on something and I'd like to read it to you now this is this is a piece entitled untitled work in progress, which is what it is. So this is not a finished piece. And I may even continue it next week. But this is all I've written so far. Look at this man coming up the path the waterlogged path. They call him the district line dentist, he has dentistry in his blood. He has blood on his shoes, blood on his shoes, talc in his hair. And as he walks along the waterlogged path, he is shouting and shouting and shouting. The blood on his shoes is still wet and warm from the slaughtering he has been engaged in up in the hills where the district line never goes. It is not the blood of humans. There are no humans in those hills, only cardboard figures and hardboard figures and balsa wood figures and an enormous colony of very, very frightening birds like savage and pitiless birds from an ancient myth. Except that these birds are real fat with feathers, and absolutely terrifying. You may have seen they're like on the sides of buses in pointy town, for it was images of similar birds that were used in that Ill conceived advertising campaign for a brand new type of fizzy and frothing detergent pill, which it was claimed would put more pepper into your pots and pans. We know that banging pots and pans is a traditional method of scarifying birds. But it would not work with these birds, the ones that perch on the cardboard and hardboard and balsa wood figures in the hills from which the man they call the district line dentist has just descended with blood on his shoes and a song in his heart. That is why he is shouting. He has a song in his heart, but he cannot sing. His song is about the sad final days of Edgar Allan Poe and the chorus replicates that numerous scenic writers dying words. Reynolds Reynolds Reynolds that is what the district line dentist is shouting as he clumps along the path in his blood soaked choose. He clumps with a limp phase legs are of uneven length only just but decisively so he was not born that way. When he was a chair Robic Bonnie baby, both his legs were measured, and they were found by several independent authorities to be identical in length. Something happened to him between then and now to mark his symmetry, something he is always blamed on the ferocious birds up in the hills. That is why he is such a bitter man and a bird hater.

He hated birds, but he was fond of moles. He had a little toy mole made of cambric and string, a puppet you could call it which sat on a china played on the dresser in the parlor of the boarding house by the seaside where he lived. Seeing a mole on a plate. Many people chided the district line dentist that it looked as if he wanted the mole for his dinner or bed that it was only a cambric and string toy. The presence of a knife and fork alongside the plate served only to emphasize this misapprehension, but that was part of his plan, or I should say part of one of his many plans. dentistry was in his blood, but he no longer practiced that trade. For he was an old old man retired to receive side boarding house, a boarding house named after Ray Mel and the film star who memorably appeared in The Man with X ray The gardens of the boarding house were riotous with Fox gloves. And as you may know, Fox gloves are poisonous to molds. At least that is the case in the land of which I speak. It may or may not be the case elsewhere in the boundless universe. But of course the foxglove which foxgloves which bloomed in the rainbow land boarding house gardens were not harmful to the district line dentist's mole, for it was but a toy, a placing sat on its plate on the dresser. The cutlery aligned next to the plate was of exquisite workmanship of the finest metal manufactured. According to legend by gnomes, though the tales told of these gnomes were full of holes and every version was different. Sometimes the gnomes were said to live under a big bright mountain far away. And sometimes they were said to spend their lives jetting from one Paradise Island to another, making their knives and forks and spoons during stopovers in airports snack bars. In truth, nothing can have been more mundane than the actual making of the cutlery and gnomes played no part in it really. Every last teaspoon and sugar Tom was made in a great grim factory guarded by beagles plunked in a field at the end of the district line hallelujah field where no grass grew only weeds and tears.

There are storms in teacups, and barn storms. But it's a very particular sort of storm that engages our attention now. Henry cow recorded a piece entitled bitten storm over boom, the title taken from a passage in one of Charles forts compendium of anomalous phenomena. And likewise, we are dealing with a storm of birds. For up in the hills where the district line never goes. a surge of magnetism convulsed the colony of terrifying birds, and they filled the sky screeching and shrieking, maddened beyond measure. Hearing the racket, the dentist clumps to a halt on the waterlogged path. His shoes were steeped in the blood of slaughtered birds, but for each one he had killed, dozens more had appeared flapping in from who knows where gathering in the hills, perched and brooding and awaiting the burst of magnetic energy sending them into a storm in the sky. But this was pointed town, not all, and these were no bitterns. And the waterlogged path that came down from the hills led in its meandering way to a cluster of hats on the beach hats that once belonged to boatbuilders Knower figures whose beards was stiff with the salt of the sea. Long gone now, the boats they built, shattered and broken, wooden fragments scattered across the sands eaten by worms, as those who built the broken boats were themselves devoured as they lay in their tombs in the pretty churchyard of St. bibley. Dip Dibs hard by the beach and popular with poets, sand worms and earthworms. And the work they do have been ignored by graveyard poets of pointy town, and for that they should be ashamed. The district line dentist was heading for the hat where once boats had been built, for there, he believed he would find sanctuary from the vengeful birds. Pear lands and for me a are among those who have written authoritatively about ritual appeasement of bird gods. And while I'm not suggesting for one moment that there is a divinity lurking in the breasts of those screeching horses in the sky over the hills, the sky now black with this whooping flapping savagery, incidentally, yet we would do well to recall in particular perelandra is nostrum regarding protecting shrouds. But of course, that poppin j righto knew nothing of birds driven bonkers by eerie magnetic force edge, which we still do not fully understand. Luckily for him, the district line dentist did.

It was no accident that the church by the beach was consecrated to St. bibley, Deb, Deb, for he was the patron saint of something or other resonant of marine life. He is one of those Saints for whom there is no convincing evidence of his actual existence. And it may be that he was simply a phantom shimmering in vapors from the brains of seaside mystics. buried in the churchyard was one such mystic, a wise woman known as the woohoo whoopty woo woman, legend in those parts held that she was who had fallen foul of the birds in the hills, and had pelted the old boatbuilders with potatoes until they ceased to build boats, and that she had done so because she lived in mortal Fear not only of the birds, but of the sea. hideous aquatic beings haunted her nightmares, from which she would awake, crying, whoo hoo whoopty Woo, hence the name by which she was known. intriguingly on the 22nd of November 1963, the day of the Kennedy assassination, she awoke screaming Reynolds Reynolds Reynolds, like Edgar Allan Poe on his deathbed, but we do not know why an auditory ever divulge her dream, even to the district line dentist, who did her bridge canal work and praised the enamel of her Molas and was her confident and some said her in Marotta, all those years ago, before the frightening birds haunted the hills, and while boats were still built in the cluster of hats on pointy town beach, the hats clustered between two coastal features called Empire glue and sacchetti sack. She was invariably dressed even for stoned in those days in a maroon shawl, that Whoo hoo woo the woman. Maroon two was the color of the plumage of the most frightening of the frightening birds did the shawl act as her protective trout ally Palembang, the district line dentist suffered from Doulton ism or colorblindness and he knew not what Maroon walls know how it differed from blue.

So that's untitled work in progress, and the should be more event next week. Meanwhile, this is called a refutation of some of the less plausible claims made by Dennis kargh pan in his woeful lecture delivered from the balcony of the Civic Hall at Bhadra Spinney on Thursday last during a hailstorm to a gathering of in grades and orphans. I wish to refute while sipping from a glass of milk of magnesia some of the less plausible claims made by that odious charlatan Denis kargh. Pan in his woeful and let's face it, mercenary lecture delivered from the crumbling balcony of the Civic Hall at Bhadra Spinney on Thursday last drawing the most tremendous hailstorm I have ever seen in my life, to a gathering of best deal in grades and orphans, who were corralled into the square by kargh pans team of electric cattle prod wielding ruffians and forced to applaud his preposterous statements. Chief among these statements was his contention that toads are shy, usually Nocturnal Animals hiding during the day in dark, damp places and hopping about at night in search of insect grubs, slugs, worms and other invertebrates that they are often brownish or grayish in color and have warty skin. A flat head swollen parotid glands on the side of the neck behind the eyes, bright jewel like eyes with a transverse pupil and slightly webbed toes, but they are often stouter than frogs and cannot leap as far. But the tongue of the toad is attached to the front of its mouth, that the tongue is flicked forward from the mouth, and the sticky tip grasps the prey and carries it back to the mouth. But unlike most frogs, most toads do not have teeth, that the tongue produces quantities of mucus to help him swallowing that all anurans blink when they swallow, and because there is no bone between the eye The mouth, the eye is pushed against the roof of the mouth, forcing the food further back. Let me just sip some milk of magnesia before refuting this twaddle

Frank Key  15:16
there, I refute it utterly. I do not refute it on the basis of scientific fact, nor on my own acute observation of the natural world, nor do I refute it, because I have read many, many learned papers about toads, which counter these statements. Similarly, I do not refute it in homage to my mother, who was a self proclaimed expert on toads and passed down her hard won knowledge to me, because basically, my mother was bonkers and confused toads with Rennes and it should come as no surprise that all those articles about Toad she sent off to the Reader's Digest and the Daily Telegraph Sunday magazine were written from her room in the st. Cynthia Mercy Home for the deranged and the bewildered. No, I refute this drivel simply because I bear a grudge against Dennis kargh pan. One day he will burn in hell. In the meantime, I shall not rest for my refutations of every word. He asked us from that pinched and slippery mouth of his. Well, may he regret the day. He chuckled at my Buffon.

Time now for all fictional substance of the Week. This week, the fictional substance of the week is ecor or ichor. IC h o R. Imagine you are in ancient Greece, taking a stroll on Mount Parnassus. One of the gods of Greek mythology suddenly appears in front of you imagined to that you will not have a placid and thoughtful nature, as I'm sure you are, but a temperamental hothead, prone to violence. surprised by the sudden appearance of a deity, it doesn't really matter which one, your first instinct is to lash out in terror and alarm. You suck the God on its jaw, cutting it to lip. Now, it is not blood which flows from the wound, but ecor a colorless ethereal fluid, which ran through the veins of all the Greek gods. If you are a vampiric bent, be sure not to suck the ecore oozing from the gods cutlip for though it confers immortality on the deities, it will be ruinous to you as a mere human, for it will poison You. Lord Byron wrote, he pattered with his keys at a great rate and sweated through his apostolic skin. Of course, his perspiration was but equal, or some such other spiritual nicor weather echo is the root of the word icky as in that sponge pudding was so icky that I felt a great wave of nausea overwhelm me to the point of lovecraftian Horror is a moot point. Sometimes echo is not fictional. in geology, a CT is a technical term denoting a fluid or emanation from a magma which is held to cause granite eyes ation of a rock. And in medical parlance, it means the watery ooze from an abrasion, scar or wound. Do not be mistaken next time. Uz seeps from one of your wounds that you have somehow been transformed into an immortal super being. Rather than saying as the Emperor Vespasian dead on his deathbed, oh, I must be turning into a god. You should instead go and see your doctor. All the better if your doctor surgery is that the lip of a magma riddled volcano. Next week's hooting yard fictional substance of the week will be flooded with storm

A Series of Unfortunate cows misfortune can strike a cow out of the blue to give but one example the field in which it is standing may become flooded after heavy rainfall or if not flooded exactly, then pitted with many, many puddles. No cow likes to stand in water, so, such a circumstance must be counted a misfortune. The cow in the puddle however, is una Xiaoli Vash compared to the cow which in attentively wanders onto some railway tracks, and then comes to a halt. Continuing and across the tracks would be the wiser option for as long as the cow remains where it is. It is an imperiled cow. Got that and imperiled cow. Listen carefully. But unlike owls, cows are not noted for wisdom. The imperiled cow on the railway tracks may suffer the misfortune of being killed by a runaway locomotive, without a cow conscious driver at the helm. I am not sure Helm is the correct word for the little cabin in which a train driver, cow conscious or otherwise sits or stands that let that pass. What we can say with certainty is that a emotionless cow in the path of a runaway train will suffer the greatest of all misfortunes, that is, a violent death. By comparison, the previous cow, the one standing in the puddle is almost as happy a cow as the laughing cow that mysteriously appears on the wrappers of a brand of processed trees, triangles in this country, and perhaps in other countries, too. if my memory serves that laughing cow is red and white. If a real cow was red and white, it too would probably suffer this misfortune. For it coloration would make it an easy target for predators. larger, more savage beasts, ones with vision alert to bright primary colors. In this case, red would be far more likely to attack the laughing cow than a neighboring cow that was say beige or dumb, or even dappled. Such being the case. One wonders why the red and white cow is laughing. The fourth in our series of unfortunate cows is the one that is stricken by disease. In the popular mind, the most notable Cow Disease is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy up and suffer and suffer loss apathy. I'm going to start that sentence again. In the popular mind, the most notable Cow Disease is Bovine Spongiform and suffer encephalopathy. Forget it all mad cow disease. I for one can never read the technical phrase without visualizing a cow with a brain that has turned to sponge. That may be because I'm mispronouncing the word spongiform. Either way, I think we can agree that this is the least fortunate cow that we've encountered so far. Next week, we'll be taking a stroll down a pathway that leads to for more cows for sale by misfortune. Until then, your homework is as follows. answer the following questions to the best of your ability and with a certain dash. Got your pens and paper? Write? Question one. If through some eldritch soul transfer conjured by a warlock, you swap places with one of the four unfortunate cows, which one would it be? And why? Question two? Would you follow the example of the red and white cow and laugh in the face of misfortune? Or would you take steps to avert it? If so, how? Question three. What tips would you give to a cow standing in a puddle? And finally, Question four. Imagine you are a train driver. Would you be a cow conscious train driver? If so, list six separate examples of your cow consciousness. So that's this week's homework.

Well, having had a great deal of difficulty saying the word encephalopathy, encephalopathy, then I'm going to challenge myself again by attempting to read to you another piece full of words I can't pronounce properly.

I once went to see Tony Buzan give a talk and he has a very sepulchral voice. And indeed, he sports a sinister black cape. Anyway, hooting yard, we've devised a new method of training your brain. It's cheap, simple, and most importantly, it's fun.
