Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Half an hour of majestic prose. And that being so I'm going to begin this week with a poem. Small turquoise things are holed into ponds. Men with whisks lurk in the shrubbery, bandits, vomit, detectives cringe. Mr. Hobart is implacable but rubbery. And that was the poem. Much of today's show is long story an old story actually very old story that appeared in in in the legendary malice aforethought press paperback twitching and shattered. And this is called the abandoned zoo. One abandoned Zoo by the banks of the river Ach, or was it the river ik she had built herself a heart. She lined the walls with some sort of cork matting which had been bequeath to her and the will of a distant relative whose identity had never been revealed. She had received two packing cases of cork matting and a plastic carry a bag full of mud. First, she thought they must mean something be clues to some hidden treasure. But she did not know how to begin to look and as time went by, she forgot about them. She threw the mud away and stored the matting in her attic. Now, years later, it last came in useful. It was just the thing for her Riverside hut. On the other side of the river, she could see the abandoned zoo. Empty cages stood rusting and the bleak morning light. The aviary had collapsed completely. The block of administrative buildings and zookeepers quarters have been bulldozed into the ground, and her father had been responsible for this destruction. She cooked her breakfast on the portable skillet outside the heart, then sat down in the mud to chew it, staring fixedly across the river until we're descending mist obscured her view to bury yams. Mr. Ward drank and drank and drank. His friend said, Ward, you're drunk. He raised one eyebrow and spattered them. They turned away bilious and sad. Mr. Ward kept on drinking. One by one, the zookeepers joined him and they exchanged anecdotes about Arctic bears, completely demented elk, frisky goats, halitosis written iguanas, Jesuits, klaxon mouth lizards, malevolent nanowalls old pigs, quite repulsive swordfish, totally uncouth vultures, woolly zebras, and yeast eating zebras. Mr. Ward had once been a Jesuit, but he had been de frocked. Now, when not drinking, he carried around a bucket full of sprats to throw to the seals. It was not a fulfilling life. Although the seals enjoyed themselves, the Spratt didn't. Mr. Ward himself was fairly indifferent. Until the day he was thrown down a mineshaft. He was never seen again. The seals pined, and the landlord at the pub missed him. But the sprat rejoiced. Three constructing xylophones Thursday was a big day for potash. The word was on everybody's lips. The rumpled felons who mucked out, the tiger cages became particularly excited. One of their number would be chosen to shovel the potash onto the truck. By noon they would all be hanging around the potash shed eyes gleaming with eagerness. Often I miss lunch, anxious not to lose their chance. by three o'clock with nerves taught and hearts thumping. Their muttering would rise in both speed and volume until it became a chorus of baleful wailing. And then, the rumble of tires on grit, as the big truck from the xylophone factory hurtled through the zoo entrance, breaking sharply by the potash shed. The driver, a surly man named dweb lurched off to the canteen without a word as ever, he would be fed a huge bowl of turnips free of charge courtesy of the management.

Unknown Speaker  05:13
Outside by the potash shed, the rumpled felons jabbering died down as the time came for the shovel to be named. Dr. quill appeared shovel cradled lovingly in his arms. He spoke briefly and then nodded towards one of the felons who shuffled gratefully forwards to accept the shovel. Those who had been passed over this time gradually drifted off with much grumbling, lamentation, rending of garments and gnashing of teeth. Dr. quill returned to his office. potash was shoveled onto the truck. The driver returned, he drove the truck to the xylophone factory at hooting yard. The potash was shoveled into a cellar on the factory floor production could resume sirens blared, engines chugged the clang of hammer on Advil industry

Unknown Speaker  06:35
for dreadful weather. The mist began to clear her trousers were damp from squatting in the mud. She went inside the heart and nailed the final piece of cork matting into place. Rough hesi and rugs covered the mud floor. There were no windows and no door only an open doorway.

Unknown Speaker  06:57
She had

Unknown Speaker  06:58
decided to paint something on the lintel something insignificant yet charged something glorious. The word calcium, perhaps, but she had no paint and no paintbrush, and the shops were shot and it started to rain. She smeared wax onto the rugs to stiffen them, but hours later, it was still raining. She heard a sort of glop sound coming from the river loud and intriguing, but she did not investigate. Five extremely vociferous you drink too much Mr. Ward. You do not spend your life throwing sprats out of a bucket Dr. quill that is irrelevant Mr. Ward. I throw one sort of fish to another sort of fish morning noon and night for a pittance if I should choose to spend that Pitons on booze who use again say me Dr. quill I beg your pardon, Mr. Ward. The fish eat fish. I drink beer. A man must live Dr. quill. A seal is not a fish, Mr. world. That is irrelevant. My arguments remain valid and coruscating Dr. quill Get out of my office at once. Mr. Ward. I intend to remain here until you tell me what happens to all that potash Dr. quill that is none of your concern, Mr. Ward. I am nevertheless intrigued Dr. quill. Pray why Mr. Ward. I never cease to be astounded each Thursday by the Craven cow towering of the Tiger cage muckers, their pitiful slobbering eagerness to shovel potash onto a truck is a sight vial to mine eyes. God knows I've tried to reason with them. I've spent long hours in the pub trying to unravel the intricacies of their behavior, but it remains beyond my can. I have come to you that you may shed light on the matter. Dr. quill Am I given to understand that you're sowing discord among the employees Not to mention mutiny, such conduct imperils the efficient running of the zoo Mr. Ward? Quite possibly So Dr. quill? I shall have you sacked for this Mr. Ward. I'm afraid that cause of action is not open to you Dr. quill.

Unknown Speaker  09:34
Why so Mr. Ward? I have here in my pocket and illuminated valiant with ticket chaps. Dr. quill. Good God, Mr. Ward. I think you will admit that there's cast an entirely different light on things Dr. quill. Tick, could you say Mr. Ward, precisely Dr. quill I appear to have no option. But to lay before you the full ramifications of the matter, Mr. Ward. Indeed it would appear so Dr. quill ticket chaps my hat. Well, this may take some time. Allow me to offer you a drink Mr. Ward. Thank you Dr. quill, a slug of something ferocious will suit be fine. Six fairly unpleasant. Extensive dental work done little to quell Dr. quills smugness concerning his mouth. He packed food into it, relishing his own teeth and tongue as much as he saved the masticated slop but dribbled down his throat. He sat at his table, gobbling krill and pondered Mr. wads dummies by the light of the candelabra. He could have him set upon by thugs in a darkened lonely warehouse by the docks. He could shoot him with a high velocity rifle from a vantage point concealed behind shrubbery in a public park or Plaza. He could send him a sachet, ostensibly a free sample of shampoo, but in reality a deadly poison which entering the pores of his scalp would cause implacably through his entire body ravaging him with fit dementia, paralysis and death. He could arrange for him to go on around the world cruise on the pretext of official Zoo business. And when the ship was halfway around the world have it torpedoed by piratical mercenaries. He could lure him into a disused barn or other farm building both the doors with enormous padlocks and incinerate him. He could have him buried under a pile of rocks. He could arrange a puzzling faked suicide involving rope I blow torch chicken wire pastry cutters and bleach. He could encase him in concrete and hurl him over a cliff. He could send him a parcel of explosives. Why did detonate when opened. He could have him press ganged into a private army and sent off to fight in a distant foreign war, trusting to luck that he would meet his doom. He could challenge him to engage in hand to hand combat on a perilous mountain ledge, then produce as if from nowhere, a glistening Scimitar to give himself an unassailable advantage. He could have him bound hand and foot helpless and immobile in the path of a high speed express train. He could train a voucher to purchase from Mr. Ward's roof, biding his time until it Maleficent dividual caused Ward gaunt and fearful to perform some desperate self obliterating act out of spiritual terror. He could fling him down a mineshaft seven grand tradition the xylophone factory hooting yard was founded by bales lavender mouth in 1861. Lavender mouth was the son of a Peruvian wrestler and a West Australian bandage Steiner and the the age of 17 inherited a vast fortune due to a clerical error. By the time he was 20, he'd spent virtually the whole amount attempting to destroy all world religions within his lifetime. taking his sister's advice not to waste what was left of the money, he removed himself to the small town of Hoon, and worked for 10 years, building the xylophone factory with his bare hands. It is a classic piece of industrial architecture, bass, British and the monolithic. Although still known by its original name, the factory has not produced xylophone since 1892 when lavendar mouth died, a succession of businesses rented the premises from his sister over the following years, and by turns the factory turned out whisks brambles, cuddles litmus paper Dowling, Vainglory distemper, and spring in 1947, the present owners took over the building pledge to resurrect the visionary genius of bales lavender mouth, their attempts to construct working copies of the original xylophones met with a lot However, on St. Mungo's day 1950, a fire destroyed much of the factory interior.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
reconstruction was slow but determined and the owners took a pause to rethink their decision was worthy of lavender mouth himself, their guiding spirit. The factories entire resources were henceforth devoted to the production of inspirational choir funnels with attendant hatches and loving. Great sellers were built underneath the factory where stores of zinc mulberries, potash and gulland pig iron and chab are continually stacked up furnaces burn machines hums, an old stained glass windows are smashed to pieces with gigantic steam hammers. For all this activity, however, I can tell lies at the heart of the xylophone factory. A gray and dismal portrayal of bales lavender mouth, hanging on the wall of the boardroom looks down on witnesses evermore fiendish pneus and sin carried out in his name. ate her skull. her skull was dented in several places. She did not know why. She stared at the role of tarpaulin which had been abandoned in the turnip field next to her heart. It seemed to have something printed on it, she decided to take a closer look and Dawn her Wellington boots actually clambered over the fence. She heard another sort of glop sound from the river pure and urgent. Turning to look she lost her balance and fell banging her head on an old turn. This created another dent in her skull and left her insensible. It was still raining.

Unknown Speaker  16:25
Nine is the band's recordings. Historians estimate that only four or five of the xylophones built by bales lavender mouth are still extant. Of these, only one has been positively identified. Since 1950. It has been in the possession of East van scrim jaw, and international beekeeping expert and amateur musician is trans compositional methods are idiosyncratic but effective. Following the usual round of lecture tools declaiming on the joys of Roman Catholic beekeeping is fine embarks on a week of reckless Hedden ism. He attempts to satisfy every vise he can think of often falling foul of the law in the process. He returns home frazzled and disheveled and consumed by self loathing. Thus, wracked with guilt. He bolts the doors and proceeds to expiate his wretchedness by means of prolonged improvisational forays on the lavender mouth xylophone. Every single moment of these performances is taped. The results are then released to CDs on his fans own label. There are no cuts. In fact, no editing of any sort, quality control and critical selectiveness have no part to play in this project. Is plan presses only small limited editions of his records, and for the collector they can be devilishly hard to obtain. A full catalog of his works would fill too much time here. But the list which follows is, however fairly representative songs of rapaciousness light and turpentine, the terps house and other pieces, his van scrim jaw and his enticing xylophone, the lighthouses, stank, and other songs, turpentine light turpentine Valley smooching with this town house of terps, a sonata 10 jumbled questions. While Dr. quill implicated in the murder of Mr. Ward heavily. What are the names of the present owners of the xylophone factory? Hard to say without fear of contradiction? When is the feast day of St. Mango? January the 14th What did bales lavender mouth look like? The flesh of his face was pocked and gray. He sported a massive walrus mustache and from time to time and unkempt goatee beard. His ears protruded to a rather unfortunate extent, the left ear moreso than the right. His eyes were alight with frenzy and other despite the curse of recurrent conjunctivitis. His nose was like that of a man partial to drink, reddish purple bulbous, and given to developing a legion of unsightly pustules. Yet lavender mouth was a lifelong teetotaller his mouth was thin and twisted into a permanent watery smile. Hair sprouted in uneven, matted tufts on his scalp and down his cheeks. His head have the overall appearance of a blighted potato. Is there any solid evidence linking Dr. quill with Mr. Ward's mystery assailant? Not as yet. The police are likely to have been diverted by a red herring, such as the telephone numbers of several prominent figures of the Scandinavian underworld were found written on a torn piece of blood Paper discovered in a waste bed in Mr. Ward's brother's kitchen. That is merely one example. How did Mr. Ward meet his end? On Friday the sixth of October he was walking home from the zoo. He was set upon by an unknown assailant, who, having bashed him on the head with a bridle, proceeded to throw him down and abandoned mineshaft some 400 yards distant. What is the rhyme associated with some mango? The tree that never grew the bird that never flew the fish that never swam the bell that never rang? Was the zoo owned by Dr. quill. Partly, what was bayles lab in the mouse real name is given on his birth certificate. Often shaly manbat was Mr. Walden a picture of gambling dens and other low places and sinks of corruption and infamy. Yes. What was Dr. quills first name? Agamemnon. In what year did mango die 610 ad. What was it Dr. quills account of his whereabouts at the time Mr. Ward met his death.

Unknown Speaker  21:14
Dr. quill stated to the police officer who interviewed him that he taken an official trip to Iceland to meet and parley with a gang of scientists involved in research into krill. He was able to provide an corroborative evidence an airline ticket and an Icelandic daily newspaper, printed in Reykjavik and dated Friday the sixth of October. In addition, forensic experts remove traces of melted Arctic snow from Dr. quills bath sponge. What other name did bales lavender math assume at certain times in his life and why? Thomas Vander Blue Lee out of sheer bloody mindedness. Who were the main customers for the inspirational choir funnels with attended hatches and loving made at the xylophone factory. Accounts differ. According to one annual report, mysteriously undated, the bulk of the produce is exported to various Latin American oligarchies. Yet a spokesman for the xylophone factory has stated on a number of occasions that the inspirational choir funnels are almost all snapped up by private collectors scattered throughout the world, with no great concentration in any one continent. Oddly, this version is not accompanied by any information regarding the hatches, lobbying, or indeed the provisional loving, which accounts for an increasing share of the factory's total output. It was Mr. Ward's belief, however, that, quote, there were some funny kind of tie in with the zoo, unquote. Dr. quill has refused to answer questions related to this angle. It is thought that Mr. Ward was collating a body of evidence in support of his accusation, and that he was close to the completion of this work when he met his end. But this remains merely conjecture on the part of inspector AB Deb and his trusty team of detectives, who, together with their sniffer dogs seem to have embarked on a long and torturous case with no end in sight. Is it true that his fans screamed or recorded a four hour xylophone solo entitled The bell that never rang and that a scratched copy of the disc minus its dust jacket was discovered underneath the sink in Mr. wods bathroom? Yes, on both counts.

Unknown Speaker  24:01
11 krill purveyor laws shivered. He sat hunched on a stool huddled in thin blankets is balaclava had seen better days, filthy snow caked his traitorous beard. Gray blacks largely in pooled about his feet. He led another cigarette and checked his watch. It had stopped at 10 past six. He had lost the key for the padlocks on the big crate. But that wasn't his problem anymore. He stood up and began to pace around the shed kicking his ludicrous boots at the walls. Why had he agreed to this tryst here in a rotting outbuilding at the edge of the worm farm, there were surely more salubrious places where they could count equally well on secrecy. He rummaged in his pocket and pulled out the last of the turnip sandwiches, biting into it. He cursed the day he had become involved. Suddenly the door crashed open and at all hooded figure trudged into the shed carrying a parcel in expertly wrapped with brown paper string, old newspapers gum Plaster of Paris and spittle. The figure admitted to low hoots Lars gulped. He knew that these would be the hoots of destiny 12 left open. The funeral of bales lavena mouth took place on January the 14th 1897 at something mangoes on the app. The great man had been dead for five years, but there have been problems finding the corpse in accordance with his last will and testament lavender mouth sister had had the cadaver encased in a block of ice and ferry to Iceland. There she paid a small sum to a jolly jack tar to sail the body in his tag further north there to be more completely in tuned in dense pack eyes. publicity for this escapade caused them out. publicity for this escapade caused an outcry in the press, and the issue was debated in Parliament. Several Archbishop's demanded that Hilda blonde vain Stroh lavender mouth sister be hanged for her iniquity. The brouhaha died down whoever and would have rested there were it not for the involvement of a shabby private detective named Valentine scrimshaw. Miraculously, he tracks down lavender mouth cadaver imbedded in ice and perfectly preserved and had it shipped back to the mother country. No one knows why he did this. He gained nothing except a footnote in a boring and virtually unreadable history book long out of print. Screen draw was one of the few people to attend the funeral, which did not have Hilda's blessing. Temperatures plummeted on the morning that the service took place. snowdrifts built up around the church, lavender mouth coffin was left open throughout, and his corpse almost fell into the snow. When one of the badly paid pallbearers stumbled. There is no record of why St. Mungo's was chosen. It was a small stone church long fallen into disrepair. At the time of the funeral, the doors were hanging off their hinges. The altar lay smothered under a blanket of dust, and the bells in the tower were cracked and tuneless. The church stood within the bailiwick of smatter a place with no connections to lavender mouth, his family or his history. His great xylophone factory stands 40 miles away to the west. So mangoes was firebombed by a crack squad of rational arsonists in 1942. surveying maps of the site one day, eight years later, Valentine scrim Joe's grandson decided to build a zoo. 13 missed nothing. She eventually regained consciousness, bruised and muddy her skull freshly dented, she ignored the role of tarpaulin and trudged back to her heart. She got down icy water from the spigot and saw that the mist was descending again. Within minutes, the abandoned Zoo across the river was utterly invisible.

Unknown Speaker  28:56
So that was the abandoned zoo, and not much time left this week time just for an excerpt from some lesser known editions of the Bible. And this is a little note about Bill's groose Bible, a decidedly run Bible published in 1804 by mafic, builds group of whom little is known by his height. The Holy text is rendered almost incomprehensible in that all references to wooden things, things with wings, fruit, four legged animals, blunt instruments, states of misery, ointments, bandages, heroic baking, custard, rubbing alcohol, rainfall holes, swimming, crocus's, pestilence, hail storms, derision, trees, crumbling pastry, whisks, whiskey, Boric, acid imbecility, signposts, deafening noises, and rotating things have been expunged. And that's all we have time for on hooting out on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it, and I'll be back again next week at the same time. Bye bye.
