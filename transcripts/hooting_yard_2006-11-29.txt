Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. And this is hooting yard on the air live from Denmark Street with me Frank key for half an hour of pros. And before I continue, before I forget, I just like to mention that the the online presence on the worldwide interweb of hooting yard has moved to a much simpler address, which is www dot hooting yard.org so go there and have many many hours of fun. Shut your mouth wine drinking pontiff. Those were the words on a placard at a protest. Pope Benedict's current visit to Turkey where various Islamic Islamic people have demonstrated against against Pope Benedict. whatever else you may say about them. They know how to brandish a good placard. I mean, shut your mouth wine drinking pontiff kind of puts to shame all that kind of vapid bush and Blair Ooh, we hate you that you get over here in the West. And this and there does seem to be something about the one time Cardinal Ratzinger that clearly inspires the perpetually offended Islamised to their finest placards. My favorite and the winner of hooting yards favorite demonstration placard of the year goes to one that the pope inspired a while ago after his office after he said said bad things about Islam in some speech in Germany. And and this this placard says our last Pope Benedict has lost his mental and moral balance. And if you go to the housing yard website, you can see that a photograph of the placard being held aloft by many, well, I think they're women, but they're all covered in entirely black shroud so it's difficult to tell. And moving on this is a piece called shriveled. When I removed the shrivel human head from the burlap sack, my first thought that was that there must have been foul play as detectives like to call it but I'm not a detective and foul play seemed incongruous in this some dappled Meadow splattered with buttercups, Tansy and wild hollyhocks under a gorgeous blue sky. Just before stumbling upon the sack. I had been singing at the top of my voice, singing a happy song, one of my own devising a plan of praise to bees, extolling the virtues of the splendid, buzzy insects. And I was dressed like a bee sort of in a black and yellow hooped jumper and black leggings and a black cap upon my head. There was no cap or hat of any sort on the shriveled head I took from the sack, just a few strands of filthy matted hair. I sat on the grass and took a pair of snippy bookchin scissors out of my pocket and gave the shriveled head a much needed haircut. And I made a little pile of the clippings on a patch of bare soil and set fire to it were the match, and it blazed. Oh, so briefly, sparkling and crackling, and then all it was left was a trace of ash. I plopped this trivial head back into the burlap sack, swung it over my shoulder, and headed off towards old farmer frack pig farm, singing lustily. No one knew how old old farmer frack was, and no one could remember a time when he was not squelching about in the mud at all hours of the day and night raising his pigs. As farms go It was a tiny farm. But all farmer frac was a giant of a man by the standards of that land, and his pigs grew to giants to under his care. It was a mystery how he made his living there. He never took his pigs to market to sell them. When they reached a size that made them too big for the tiny farm. He drove them up into the hills and let them loose. That is why dutiful parents Warn their children against going or wandering alone in the hills and tell terrifying tales of giant rampaging pigs, which capture and carry off misbehaved infants in their big trumping drawers.

Unknown Speaker  05:18
I found old farmer frack engulfed in a fog of calorie fumes in his kitchen. He was preparing his lunch, a concoction of jugged Hare, devils, kidneys and blow monje and he was cursing like a sailor, for he had inadvertently jug to the kidneys and devil the hare, one of his pigs, not yet Titanic in stature, was rooting around the skirting boards, looking perhaps for beetles or other creeping things. I patted the pig on it Shanks if pigs have Shanks and placed my sack on the table. This might interest you old farmer frack, I said, helping myself to a tumblers worth of water from the spigot. Except for his maritime curses learned when he was butter boy. old farmer frack was a man of few words, he had the sack and he eyed me and he eyed his spigot. Then he put down his drug full of kidneys and open the sack with unnecessary vigor, causing the shrivel human head to roll across the table and toppled to the floor. To its credit, the pig ignored it. Oh, farmer frac, stared at the shriveled head and immediately made the sign of the cross. I had no idea he was pissed pig farmer. I just snipped the gory locks off this gory find, I said, and then I burned them. I stooped to lift the head back onto the table. But old farmer frack clouded me with a main force and I crumpled to the floor. unconscious for a few seconds. I came to with the pig's snout in my face, the shriveled human head was perilously close to one of the pigs cloven feet, and I feared that it would be crushed should the pig become excitable and begin stamping. Thinking Fast, I raised my hand up and patted the pig soothingly. Previously when I had patted it Shanks or what I believed to be Shanks, if pigs have Shanks, I had done so in a perfunctory manner matches one might Chuck a dog under the chin. Now I will duplicate three forces of Boltzmann's movement number seven a into my hand that I might communicate absolute calm. At this point, old farmer frack smashed me on the head with a spade typical of a farmer, I thought to keep a spade in his kitchen, and then I passed out for hours. I was woken by the unbearable sound of a transistor radio blaring into my ears unbearable, because on radio pipsqueak, it was apparently you today and the noise assailing me was the voice of the preposterous Paul nawbo Heusen a krisztian Irish millionaire given to taking court action to retrieve a pair of trousers and a hat. I lunged to deaden the sound in any way I could, and saw old farmer frac looming above me, his bowels smeared with vestiges of deviled hair, drugged kidneys and below Monge. You brought me the wrong head. He said le goob riously. That's the end of that piece. Just to let you know, of course that the mention of Paul nabo Heusen going to court to retrieve a pair of trousers and a hat is entirely true. The man who would have saved the world by getting the rest of us to hand over our money is quite happy to spend 1000s and 1000s and 1000s retrieving a coat a coat hat and, and trousers which apparently have iconic status. So if that's not self importance, I don't know what is my own trousers of course have a great deal of iconic status and if you'd like to bid for them in an auction, just let me know.

Unknown Speaker  09:57
Cool sometimes with the media like right And television and so on, there's a great mystique about how programs get made. So I thought readers, readers, readers listeners, I thought readers might. I'm gonna start again, I thought listeners might enjoy a behind the scenes look at how Houdini out on the air is made. Four or five hours before transmission time, the recording studio is thoroughly disinfected by a crack squad of specialist cleaning workers dressed in what looked like astronauts outfits. They are armed with a panoply of highly intriguing tools, instruments and tweezers, many of which have no apparent purpose. The resonance FM HQ for those of you who don't know, is located in a subterranean basement far far below the London streets and is only accessible via an underground pneumatic capsule railway system last used in the 1880s but which has been preserved like a fly in amber by a group of enthusiasts, all of whom, by a weird coincidence are named Tim, as their fathers were before them. When disinfection is complete, other preparations are made. antique Bakelite canisters are distributed to dozens of eager fac totems. Or should that be fact tota grease pans handled by imperious and jewel dappled kitchen staff, a lowered into magnificent neoclassical oven like pods of questionable vote remarkable significance. any stray toads are actually violently from workspaces. a xylophone abandoned after an earlier program is yanked off its hinges and held zestfully into a yellow xylophone waste VAT. Urgent telecommunication signals are read and read read quickly then plastered onto oblong cards, which are nailed to murals in one of the many lobbies not so tied in jumpers. incredibly huge golden flaps have to be emblazoned with diamond patterns. The dank cellar of the building is then aired.

Unknown Speaker  12:12
listeners are

Unknown Speaker  12:13
often surprised to learn that Frankie does not actually appear on the show himself. His place is taken by an actor named Ludovico boo,

Unknown Speaker  12:23
boos ability to mimic the vocal inflections of anyone who chooses his matchless and he's had a long and successful career doing so. Other impersonations apart from Frank key he has assayed essayed include sir Isaiah Berlin, Tuesday Weld, both Richard and Karen Carpenter and President Nixon's henchmen HR Haldeman of Watergate fame. an hour before hooting yard on the air is broadcast. bool is collected from the roof of his seaside compound by a helicopter disguised as an air ambulance and flown to one of the termini of the pneumatic railway on the outskirts of London. For security purposes, a different Terminus is chosen each week, the decision being made by the tropper pilot during the flight. Safely ensconced in the resonance FM HQ bullies handed the weak script together with the meal he insists on as part of his contract for bloaters a bowl of boiling hot custard, bread crumb Flan and a drug of thoroughly diluted polite potato extract, wiping his mouth on a monogrammed napkin. Baldwin enters the studio and begins to read.

Unknown Speaker  14:06
So that was me, Ludovico ball or Frank key, whichever one that's what happened. About 15 minutes ago. We're halfway through the show. Once upon a time you dressed so fine, you throw the bums or dine in your prime, didn't you? Well, No, you didn't. You should have Mr. competent at the tweezer factory told you to but you ignored him. You did worse than ignore him. You tipped his hat off his head and trod on it until it was crushed. And what did you do then? You kick the crushed hat into the gutter with a snare on your lips. And know how that snare disfigured your face. It was an ugly snare and made of you an ugly person. Something nobody had recognized until then. You who had won the hearts of a multitude through your good works in the field of bird welfare. You who could cradled crows In your arms, who had nursed an injured Starling through three long days and nights, who had fed droplets of rain water to a hummingbird, who so delicately brushed the feathers of an ostrich which had food poisoning you whose eyes lit up with glee when a flock of little bitterns soared across the blue blue sky, you for so called cassowary man, for you to betray the faith so many had in you to reveal your sinful heart by kicking Mr. Compton's crushed hat into the gutter, and not just any gutter, but a foul, filthy, stinking gutter greasy with slime for you to do that shocked us all. Now you languish in a prison cell accused of feckless act and nincompoop Arry and Mr. Compton lies buried in a distant, windswept graveyard. Oh, castle worry, man, castle worry man. We can never forgive you.

Unknown Speaker  16:23
Far too many people simply don't understand how to make the best use of glue. And hear hooting yard we've taken it upon ourselves to educate our listeners by providing some Cardinal do's and don'ts Listen, ponder and digest and never again will you stand accused of glue related tomfoolery. One, never use glue to stick your head to something it ought not be glued to. For example, you should avoid gluing your head to the nest of a being which will suck out your brains. To do not confuse glue with a gum, some gum can be chewed. Indeed, such gum is often called chewing gum. You cannot chew glue, and you will rue the day you do should you be such a nincompoop poop. So to do. Three, make sure you read Dobson's various pamphlets on the subject of glue, all of which are highly informative. I particularly recommend the adhesive properties of 600 different types of glue, with diagrams out of print, but sometimes salvageable from rubbish tips in the vicinity of glue making factories. This pamphlet has been condemned by a number of commentators as being a Farrago of lies and bile written by Dobson in order to exact revenge upon one of his enemies, but you should read it anyway. For even if the so called facts with which it is packed or false and inaccurate, you will still learn much enabling to hold your own in any argument concerning glue. For some glues are designed for very specific purposes. For example, library paste is a thick and glutenous whereas mucilage is thin, clear and gelatinous. Don't get the two mixed up or you may be beset by adherents issues. And none of us wants to face such a circumstance bereft of glue knowledge alone, puny in a cold and pitiless universe.

Unknown Speaker  18:47
No.

Unknown Speaker  18:50
And that's quite enough about glue for today. So I'd like to move on and there's been a kind of running theme this week of nincompoops hats and things like that. And trousers and those sorts of things have been turning up in the in the in the tails. I think they turn up here too. This is a story called The potatoes of potato bag.

Unknown Speaker  19:20
When did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of potato bag. I was asked this question while standing on a bridge over a muddy river in our high wind. I was wearing Spats as usual, minding my own business and humming the theme tune to the exciting TV quiz show cormorant or grieb. It was pouring with rain, but I didn't care for a top of my head. I wore a sprightly wide brimmed hat, all golden and decked with plastic chrysanthemums. Yes, dear listener. I was the Spats and the hat man. You have heard so many stories about I remember when you were tiny, and my mom tucked you up in bed and opened the treasury of bedtime Tales for pallid and sickly infants, and how you begged her to ignore the vapid rubbish about giants and dragons and magic kingdoms and what have you, and to go straight to the stories of the Spats and Hackman? Well, that's me. But of course, you would never have been told the tale of this particular day that found me standing on a wind swept bridge in a downpour being questioned about the potatoes or potato bag, because it was only yesterday, and there has not yet been time for my scribe to Boswell and account ready for the printing presses. In truth, I have a team of scribes who work in relays. One follows me about morning, noon and night scribbling down my doings. One sits at a desk in the chalet making a fair copy of yesterday's scribblings one types up the fair copy in the chalets computer pod one supervises the printing of the typed copy one carts the printed copies around to all the kiosks where they can be purchased, and one has a day of rest often spent studying the swans downriver. I am a lucky Spats and hat man to have so many Boswell's at my beck and call, even if they can be a tiresome bunch. Let me briefly describe their shortcomings one by one who been turned is curdled and indiscreet. tack is blind. Dale Winton has pins in his legs and a metal plate in his skull, and his favorite tipple is the boiled blood of ducks. Poop is a nincompoop who do breath is a swivel eyed Stalinist maniac whose cardigans always bear traces of yesterday's sausages. The sixth Boswell is actually named Boswell or rather Boswell Boswell. This one topples over far too often for my liking. So yesterday it happened that I was accompanied by this Boswell Boswell person. There I was standing on the bridge in the rain, harming and peering over across the fields to weather flocks and pansies and pinks, the hellebore and hollyhocks, the marigolds, verbascum, and char lochend. Mimosa, spurge, Goss and Erica, the lupins. The daffodils, the broom and Japonica, the creeping Jenny, the old man's beard and the cow parsley, the speedwell and flax and doc and hops and oxalate and crocus's and teasle and the geraniums and foxgloves and fleabane and jonquil and lobelia grow in such heavenly pro fusion. When the person from potato bag drew up beside me in his death trap jalopy and shouted When did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of potato bag. I made my reply with all the width and briault you have come to expect from the Spats and hat man. But Boswell Boswell chose that very moment to topple over yet again. And as we went on a bridge he toppled into the muddy river and he sank and with him sank the words I spoke to the person from potato bag. Words now last forever, never to find their place in a new edition of the treasury of bedtime Tales for palate and sickly infants. Infants now who will be deprived of a thin weak smile of Glee before falling to a snooze in their iron sick beds. A snooze room which who knows they may never ever awake.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
Since you've been gone all that's left is a band of gold LeMay suited troubadours. They arrived shortly after you found stuff with your gaudy reticule in one hand and a map of tan Tara beam in the other as Bob Dylan one Saying you left me standing in the doorway crying, but not for long. Soon the band arrived quite unannounced and made themselves at home. I fed them with what was left in the fridge, basil, glucose tablets and chopped up Sue it and went up to the attic to consult Dobson's little known Tip Top Encyclopedia of Tip Top pop bands out of print. downstairs, I could hear the band tuning up for what turned out to be a jam session as the young people say. And what did I learn from Dobson's book? I discovered that my uninvited but not unwelcome guests had began life as a skiffle combo called the urbane Blodgett seven, riding the 16th wave. They tried out various styles, until in 1969, they emerged utterly transformed as the pioneers of glob music. By now they'd settled on the name of the hinges and nozzles. After being told that there are other choices among them. Fog hat, the carpenters, Petula Clark, and blog wind pig had already been nabbed by other acts. The 1970s were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums, including baleful porpoise, Jesuit gore handler and irk the Shibboleth. The release of brain salad surgery was postponed indefinitely after a rival album was released by a so called prog rock group, whose name Dobson could not recall, despite all the research materials listed in what nesting bird has dubbed his most exhaustive appendix, Curiously, that phrase most exhaustive appendix was used as the title of the hinges and nozzles compilation CD, which was released and the days before they showed up in my house. They're still here, by the way, and I've told me in no uncertain terms, as the saying goes, that they will not leave until you come back to me. Oh, my darling. Oh, baby, baby,

Unknown Speaker  27:01
baby, please won't you come on home? This week, Tex Mex Jiffy bag sprites. Did you know that in the world of fairies there is a specific type of sprite which dwells within Jiffy bags of TexMex origin. These mystery of sprites are reluctant to leave the snug lining of their bags, except to flip from one to another when I become oh so lonesome and feel compelled to procreate. If you creep ever so silently into a postal sorting office in El Paso dead of night, you might be lucky enough to see a flickering splat sprite leaping between Jiffy bags. If it sees you, it will be vexed and cast a spell on you. And for 26 days and nights, you will be tormented by visions of potato headed monsters spewing Ecto plasm in every direction. But if the sprite does not see you, you will have good luck for a 12 month, possibly involving the unexpected offer of an appearance in a radio advertisement for a thrilling new detergent or bleach product. That At any rate, is what I was told by the weird woman of Wu who really would, and she has yet to be proved wrong in any of her pronouncements or incantations, except for the one about the Badger in the hedge. And that's the end of hooting yard on the air this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. I will be back next week with more dispatches from www dot routing. yard.org a very pleasing address I

Unknown Speaker  29:18
