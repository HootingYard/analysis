Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Just as I was preparing for today's show, I received an email from listener Jonathan cold class. Well, actually Jonathan just forwarded an email that he received, he forwarded it to me. And he added a note. The subject line of the email below promised so much, but of course, it was just spam. sigh the subject line of the email that he forwarded was Dobson and longevity. And indeed, what followed was twaddle I wrote back to Jonathan as follows. I find it disconcerting that Dobson is haunting the less salubrious corners of the worldwide interweb Ian from beyond the grave. That and longevity seems to be trying to tell us something, something almost lovecraftian and spooky. I may have to investigate. Of course, I haven't yet had time to make a full investigation to send agents from hemoglobin towers fanning out across the globe, with their ponderous briefcases, beaver fur headgear, badger badges and piercing eyesight. But what I have been able to do is to give the matter some deep thought, Could it really be true that the out of print pamphleteer cheated death that beneath the funeral shroud, that uncanny yellow for cut from a bolt of cheap tar Paulin from a cranberry in the brine soaked hellhole of Oh hoolahan Wharf, a top stitched with cack handed embroidery of picnics and tornados and winkels and periwinkles and strong buses and whelks and Lola egos that wrapped in it was not the dead Dobson, but an imposter or simulacrum? If so, if Dobson lived, where was he? He would be impossibly old by now creaking and crumbling. Was he trudging along alien pathways anonymous, in some distant land, his eyes, one BD the other milky, fixed straight ahead, an undead dead man plodding ever forward towards he knew not what. We had all thought our dear pamphleteer, a Wisp, a few born upon the luminiferous ether, the spindly frame he wants inhabited, discarded, holding wrapped in its hideous tarpaulin from the worm eaten jetty outside Oh hoomans Wharf post office, into the boiling sea Dobson and longevity indeed, but perhaps ill tempered and hateful, he sculpt in a booth somewhere in the outskirts, feeding on biscuits and berries and birds plucked in mid flight from the air sucking drops of rainwater from the toggles of his duffle coat. Wherever he was, the undead Dobson remained invisible to all who had known him. Yet he somehow had the ability to see the worldwide interweb with texts that none would ever read. Was he making some skewed commentary upon all those unread out of print pamphlets that poured out of him during the years before that thumb direct gathering in the Bracken and bind weed choked churchyard of some bibley did Dibs when Bell's clang glam annotations and salt tears ran down the cheeks of even the most grizzled countenance. Where was Dobson then? Did he scuttled from beneath the shroud when backs were turned? Were their conspirators who replaced him with an effigy of felt and Excelsior and cardboard and rags. Who could such conspirators have been? Certainly marigold Chu cannot have been among them, for Who would ever question the bleak desolation with which he spotted her widow's weeds.

If there's anyone to point a finger at it would be Ned blue it. Dobson had not known this urging for long. As far as we know, the two met just an hour or so before Dobson's death, or his alleged death, as we must now refer to it. Dobson had left the house to buy a new picnic camper, for it's a little known fact that he was fond of extravagant picnicking occasions and much given to hauling a hamper Stuffed to the brim with cake and pomegranates and limburger cheese and pre sliced slices of pemmican and Brazil nuts and more Brazil nuts and even more Brazil nuts and parsley and treacle pies and mashed potato and so it puddings up punishing slopes and down inclines into declivity is in the hills where bats are legion and no other human being has ever trod. Their Dobson would unpack his hamper, and scarf his food on observed one of his own out of print pamphlets propped open with a stick, chewing and reading an impervious to the wind and the drizzle. Such excursions battered the aging Dobson as much as they battered his hamper, but a picnic hamper can be replaced. And so it was on that March morning that Dobson pulled on his Belgian cadet boots, and his souvenir cardigan from the Ayn Rand exposition at Jakarta and strode off towards the picnic supplies boutique at the perimeter of old farmer fracks fields on that patch of scrub Land Beyond blister lane.

Next to the boutique was a kiosk operated by the Holy sisters of headaches and dismay, an order of nuns who dispensed bowls of soup to passing men Dickens as Dobson made his tottering progress towards picnic hurry. He was buttonhole by one of the sisters. No, hang on. I've got the wrong day sorry. The Kiosk was gone by then obliterated by livid purple death rays from a spaceship caught in a pocket of error in the continuum. I mean, the space time continuum, I think, anyway, whether soup kiosk one stood, there was no attempt, pitched there by the mighty Alfonso, a roguish refugee for many a penny circus, who promised to astonish and astound the crowds with feats of leisure demand, and prestidigitation, accompanied by his assistant, little Alphonso, the memory man, but there were no crowds that day, only Dobson, who hurried in through the tent flaps to avoid an encounter with one of his creditors. It doesn't matter which one it was lurking outside the picnic boutique, hoping to waylay the pamphleteer. Inside in the gloom, he came up on little Alfonso the memory man rehearsing his latest show stopper, a recitation of a historical Glossary of diseases peering over his shoulder to ensure that he had not been followed. Dobson slumped into a Pew, one of many pews stolen from a cathedral by the ever resourceful mighty Alfonso, and hearkened to the words of the diminutive urchin as he learned his lines. abscess, a localized collection of paths buried in tissues, organs or confined spaces of the body, read little Alphonso, often accompanied by swelling and inflammation and frequently caused by bacteria.

And as you can see, I'm preparing for a stage performance later on today, when the rains tumbled from the sky, and the townsfolk hear about will seek shelter in this our tent, as you have done for a purpose unbeknown to me. You are staring in complexity of my pointy triangular cap, I see. Well, I always wear it for rehearsals, for concealed within it attached to my cranial integuments are wires which transmit brain raised by invisible forces, thus nourishing my mental capacity and magnifying it 1000 fold. Would you like a conference pair, and the chin took two of the said fruits from a pocket and passed one to Dobson. Bear in mind that Dobson had less than an hour to live. There has never been any suggestion that he was poisoned by the pair proffered by little Alfonso the memory man, who was of course, the urchin named blew it if anyone had the means, and where with all to spirit to the still living Dobson from beneath his apparent funeral shroud, and to replace him with a counterfeit corpse. It was Ned, and that is why my suspicions rest on him. My investigations will continue. The next step is to ascertain if the mighty Alfonso may also have been involved. Unlike little Alfonso, the memory man, the mighty Alfonso was no mere stage name. That fact alone should give us pause. And so I shall Paul's

not like the doomed or maybe not doomed Dobson to gobble down a conference pair, but to stretch my legs in the direction of a pie shop to purchase a pie and to carry it in its cardboard packaging to a shrine where I will place it as an offering to appease the mad and terrible Gods before whom I bow down on Wednesday afternoons.

So as I was saying, it was when I was preparing for today's show that I got that email from Jonathan and it seems to have taken up most of the show my preliminary investigations into whether or not dogs in the out of print pamphleteer is indeed dead or not. And who knows Dobson and longevity. This is what I was going to read.

nearly the end of the show for this week, but first of all, I think you will hear a tale of the marshes. Out in the spooky marshes that dead of night nothing stirred nothing except tiny nocturnal creatures whose habitat was Marsh and fen kakanin and you might hear scribblings and scurrying fugitive wisps of sound in the otherwise eerie silence. There you sit in your concrete pillbox, a primal grenade in one hand and a mug of tomato soup in the other. The dampness of your socks is most distressing. You're distressed by the dampness of your socks in the marshes in the night. But why are you holding a hand grenade? Is this wartime? Surely in wartime, you would not be fobbed off with damp socks. A bat appears near your head and you flinch. These marshes are known for their colonies of bats. wisely you sip your soup. It is piping hot. The air in the marshes in the night is not. And that's the end of hooting out on the air for this week. I'll be back next week with more material for you. Bye bye
