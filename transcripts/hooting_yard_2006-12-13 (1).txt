Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. Ordinarily when we think of harpies, we think of Aiello, rcpt, and kulana. Or as she sometimes known Paul Dodge, the three sisters of Greek myth, Byrd women who kept stealing and befouling food from Phineas, and were generally vicious, violent and cruel. Tennyson called them, these prodigies of maryada naked illnesses, and twisted shapes of last unspeakable abominable strangers at my half not welcome, harpies. miring every dish, but that may may be more a reflection of the poet's fevered mental state than of the destructive wind spirits themselves. It would certainly be a calumny upon the character of bit tricks cambodge The so called key side harpy who haunted the harbor of Oh hoolahan Wharf that benighted sludge some seaside town a days horse ride away from hemoglobin towers. If Of course, you point your horse to south and if of course your horse is Vinnie, and fit and not lame. Nor to Burke killer, no otherwise incapacitated. You might think at a simple matter to keep your horse healthy, but no. Our equine powers are subject to a host of terrible terrible diseases, lock jaw, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at Quine, colic foal pneumonia, summer, seasonal recurrent dermatitis and equine wobbler syndrome are among the ones to look out for next time you're hanging around at the stables. And also there's a very helpful website with the admirably informative address www dot horse diseases.com to which you can refer. Don't forget to insert a hyphen between horse and diseases By the way, or your go astray as indeed you will go astray if you point your healthy horse in any direction other than South when riding from hemoglobin towers, so hooligans Wharf in order to seek out bitrix kamboj the key side harpy, who of course are meant to be talking about allow me just to prick the back of my hand with a long pin that will help to concentrate my mind. I usually use a lady's antique hat pin for what something can melodramatic practice, but believe me, a tiny amount of bloodshed is well worth it to keep awake and alert when one might otherwise not off into snooze world. Particularly embarrassing when babbling into a microphone in the middle of a live radio show. There I can read and dabit the puncture in my hand with a disinfected rag at the same time. So let us move on. Beatrix kamboj wanted to be a harpy from girlhood after she read about the mythical bird women in a little book entitled, harpies and other things that fluttered the rim of cooking vessels in ancient Greece, by DAX blieb, the notorious children, writer and historian who wrote from his cell in a big forbidding prison perched on a promontory where he was incarcerated for life after causing a series of railway disasters. The book spurred the tiny girl's imagination, but it was not as if hers was a humdrum childhood. both of her parents were vampires, or bed of a fairly nondescript variety. Not for them remote castles and sweeping black capes and glistening crystal decanters from which to pour the blood of a drank. Mr. And Mrs. kamboj were lowly salts, reduced on occasion to squeezing the last drop of gore from a fly or a blue bottle whacked with a rolled up periodical. something of a rostral Beatrix, his father tried to put it about that he was the eponymous fiend in Charles Ives his song slugging a vampire 1902 though this was Clearly twaddle is only tenuous connection with the great composer being a brief tenure, Hawking pencils and pencil sharpeners on the ferry across the Housatonic at Stockbridge.

Unknown Speaker  05:14
Actually, it would be nice if we could play slugging a vampire to you. And john, did we have a copy of Charles Ivy's song here in Australia?

Unknown Speaker  05:24
I have a look in, in the record store, which we go. And yes, we do. It's file just next to the Reverend Ian Paisley, meeting the entire works of Epson. So, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  06:04
That was slugging a vampire by Charles Ives, sang by Roberta Alexander, with piano by the wonderfully named tan Crone, and it comes in at exactly 25 seconds. Now, where was I? By the time Beatrix was born, the Cambodians had moved far, far from the Housatonic fetching up in a village that was scarcely more than a clump of unsightly wooden sheds a village so remote and dilapidated, that it did not even have a name. There is a surprising number of employment opportunities in such a godforsaken spot for a wasp draw and his wife who would shrivel to dust at the first ray of sunlight to come the dorm. Although I can't for the life of me think what they might be. I puzzled over this, and a kind friend suggested to me that perhaps the Cambodia's made a living by creeping around at night laying traps for moles and badges and weasels. So let us assume that that is what they did, and that farmers there about paid them well for their exertions that would at least explain how they came to be able to afford to send the young bitrix to a finishing school somewhere in the Habsburg Empire, where she first encountered the works of DAX blieb and set her heart on becoming a harpy. She had wanted to be a bird, she learned that as a child as the child of vampires, she could never ever be transformed into a Starling or a linate, or a night jar or unattach. Not even into a bufflehead or a crow. It was a cruel lesson, but she did not let it crush her spirit. Instead, she spent hours with the finishing school seamstress up in that weird, cold, crooked, beamed dusty style attic stitching and stitching, until she had fashioned for herself a pair of bright resplendent wings, with a span so wide when fully unfold that the old seamstress gave a gasp and swooned, clattering to the floor, more like a pile of dry sticks than a body of flesh and blood. And in her happy heart, Beatrix exalted at her power. She would have liked to fly away from the school by launching herself from the rooftops, but she was a sensible girl. She removed her wings and folded them up and stowed them in a tote bag and carried on with the day through lessons in deportment and watercolor and Piccolo and pastry finesse and recital of 20 verses by DAX glib, and only when the time came for the afternoon embroidery lesson to flit away through a side door and off into the mountains, while the staff and pupils went scurrying in search of their seamstress, now stumbling, stunned and blinded about the attic, bashing into mannequins, and tearing her paper taut skin on scattered Needles and Pins she could no longer see. And Beatrix wandered in the mountains, stretching her taffeta and organdy wings, striking fear into cow herds and their cows. Stories of the flightless bird woman circulated in the taverns. to assuage her rough offerings of food were left for her in huts and shelters and hermitages. Sometimes reckless young pups armed themselves with their father's rifles and strode up into the foothills trying not to choke on the tobacco pipes they clenched between the immature drawers. All bluster and braggadocio hot for Happy hunting. Bit tricks by now had perfected a shriek of such ferocity that the blood of those who heard it could have provided her vampire parents with plenty of ice popsicles. experimenting on the cows and cow herds. She had learned that a few energetic flapping of her wings, accompanied by her shriek could keep her safe from harm. Each and every gun toting young fool who came in her pursuit, returned to his village shriveled and slobbering and deranged. Most of them had to be locked away in gloomy cellars, their families shameful secret, quietly fed on slops for years and years, and never spoken of again.

Unknown Speaker  10:43
Perhaps they were the lucky ones for their village pals, who were strewed the Harpy hunt for one reason or another, were soon to perish in the trenches, the Great War doing for them what it did for the Habsburg Empire in which they had grown. And it was at the end of that terrible conflict that Beatrix cambogia at last came down from the mountains and made her way vaguely and without any real purpose across war torn lands until one bright day in 1921. She fetched up on the key side at Oh hooligans Wharf, and there she stayed. Beatrix realized soon enough that she inspired not one whit of terror in the rattled and retired old sea dogs who haunted the key side. These were ancient and crusty mariners who chewed fish heads when they were not downing tankards of salt, water and Grog, and most of them had seen things far more terrifying than bitrix in their years upon the high seas. pegleg Pinsent for example, over 100 years old, with Brian for blood, who now slumped, collapsed and crappy land in a key side kiosk, was thought I've seen so many shipped ghosts, that he shook still, as he had been shaking for 19 years or more. Ever since, as a callow cabin boy, he had clambered into the crow's nest of the HMS corrugated cardboard to be confronted with a sea soaked ghoul, which intoned a dreadful litany of incomprehensible maritime twaddle into his innocent ear. The goal was spindly it pulsated like a jellyfish. It gave off an odor of barnacles and rot and death, and it loomed above the tiny boy. It's boneless yet bony seeming fingers clutching at his sleeve, leaving a trail of slime, which no amount of soaking in pile after pile of borax and boiling water would ever expand. At the end of that first voyage, the young Pinsent took the tunic home to his mom, supposing her laundry skills equal to any and every stain, ghouls, smeared or otherwise, and that good woman let the fall let fall a shirt with a shriek, a shriek, compared to which bitrix kamboj is harpy How was like the song of the nightingale she had as an infant wanted to be. I Young Miss croaked pegleg Pinsent as bitrix sheltered in his kiosk during a rainstorm on her first day, on the key side, I saw many airship ghosts, and I saw ghost ships to I saw shapes in the night sky that should not have been there, and heard wailings and screams emerging from the depths, and I smell things no sailor or ever smell, and touched what no sailor ought ever touch. And all of that on my very first voyage, Miss nine years old and playing the foul oceans on the corrugated cardboard. Now then, Mr. Pinsent, said Beatrix, balancing a dainty teacup on her lap. For harpy though she was she had not forgotten her Habsburg finishing school manners. You have spoken of eldritch experiences involving four of the senses. But what of the fifth? Did you ever taste something no sailor or to have a taste as you would put it, actually posed this question. She unfold one wing a little just to see if it had any effect on the Ancient Mariner, whose beard seemed to be alive with tiny crawling forms of marine life, not easy to identify. He did not pay her wing any attention as he replied, hard tack biscuits riddled with worms miss that was my diet then as it is my diet now, he said. So the answer to your question has to be no, I suppose. I see said bit tricks demurely sweeping from her lap the crumbs of a cake she had bought at a neighboring key As she did so she flapped her one unfold wing with a certain eerie menace, and prepared to display the second pegleg. Pinsent took no notice, for he was lost and shaking in goo reverie, occasionally slurping from a tin tumbler of ROM or brine, or Rahman brine, he could not tell anymore.

Unknown Speaker  15:25
The interview petered out, polite, Beatrix thanked the old sea dog for his time and shelter, and must his filthy hair before striding out into the key side deep in thought. Clearly her harpy dumb had failed to discombobulate to the grizzled marine person. It was true she had not sad to shriek at him, but with his long experience of sea shrieking she surmised that his composure would have remained on rattled. night fell on Oh hooligans Wharf on that Wednesday, and the fat shimmering stars bitrix huddled down under a greasy green tarpaulin she found abandoned as a stretch of the key side where orcs and skewers gathered far from the hectic Tavern raucous with shanties. She took off her wings and folded them into her tote bag and placed it as a pillow and lay down among birds lulled to sleep, by the waves lapping against the rotting and crooked timber of the jetty. She dreamed harpy dreams, ferocious and merciless and demented. She stole food from kings who had displeased their gods. descending into the infernal regions, she sank her savage talents into the bellies of suicides. She tormented, unhappy sinners bound for Tartarus she luxuriated in the filth and stench of her Island nest. And when she woke on Thursday morning, that orcs and skewers had flown away and she was alone on the key side, her wings packed in her pillow. She jumped into the sea and swam elegantly as she had been taught to do at finishing school. And then she climbed out and shook herself and preened like a seabird on a rock, and she retrieved her tote bag and put her on her wings and shrieked and shrieked, and then she potted off along the key side towards a crumbling ruinous hut, where a signboard promised breakfast, and she sat down at a rickety wooden table. Its surface smeared with the slime of a ship's ghoul, surrounded by sea dogs in tatty. unraveling, sweaters stiff with wax, their rubber boots, squelching and leaking, and she tapped into a breakfast of cockles and mussels, and herring and lobster and squid and boiled water from a tide pool. Her cup alive with tiny wriggling marine beings, somehow happier at home here, far from her finishing school in the mountains of what once had been the Habsburg Empire.

I'm the Bishop of Suffolk This is what I do. Those are the words of the Bishop of Suffolk actually, when apparently he got rather the words for were at a party at the Irish embassy. And on his way home to Southern Cathedral he was found having having opened the door of an unlocked Mercedes car and was sat in the backseat throwing the child toys around the child of the parents who have own the car. Throwing the toys around and when set the alarm off, and when the owners of the car saw this gray haired man sitting in the back of their car throwing toys around and said What What on earth are you doing? He said I am the Bishop of Suffolk This is what I do. Useful learn to use next time you get in trouble with anyone I think this is called porpoise drool. And it's an instructive, instructive children's story with a moral This is how it goes. It was once believed that children frightened by thunderstorms could be emboldened by the application of a tincture of pauper's drool to their infant foreheads. When I say it was once believed, I mean to be very specific. This was once believed by one person for a very brief period of time. The person was Prince Fulgencio The so called prancing Prince, who one autumn day found his daughter, the Infanta Gertrude cowering behind an heiress in her playroom. One rarely finds an heiress these days anywhere except upon the dramatic stage. But the prancing prince had thespian inclinations, and his palace was littered with theatrical props. Why for art they are carrying so behind the errors as thunderclaps render the sky, asked the prince. In reply, the Infanta Gertrude whimpered in terror as a fresh thunderclap rent of the sky. Her playroom was on the topmost floor of the palace, and its ceiling had been removed, exposing the room to the mighty firmament overhead. The prince wanted to toughen his daughter up in preparation for a life of ruthless tyranny, and it dismayed him to see her milk SOP ways that it was that he strode off into the weird woods of wubi who be who to consult with the wise woman. He found her oblivious of the storm, tossing fallen and gathered crab apples to her team of pigs. The wise woman was a shapeshifter. And on this particular day, she could have been mistaken for Nova Pilbeam, that siren of the British screen, who in the 1930s starting Alfred Hitchcock's young and innocent and the first version of the man who knew too much. The prince explained his predicament, the wise woman, more intent upon her pigs than upon this strutting royal get made up some blather about paupers drool off the top of her head. Prince for Geneseo listened carefully scribbled some notes down with a bio in his Filofax remarked upon the wise woman resemblance to lab Pilbeam paid her with a pregnant pig he had found wandering disconsolate in the weird woods, and pranced princely and preening back to the palace. There he commanded his loathsome servants odo and Udo to scour the countryside collecting drew from paupers in the teeth of the still raging storm. They did so returning many hours later, with two brimming iron pails, the prince took the pails and swept into the kitchen down in the basement of the palace, and called for old mob Blunkett his cook to prepare a tincture from the porpoise drool just as the wise woman had prescribed. lightning flashed and thunder roared up in the playroom is still cowering behind the heiress, the Infanta, Gertrude was startled to receive a message on her metal Tapping Machine. It was from Professor siggers mundo, the wild haired, wild eyed boffin, who had been banished from the Princeton a year before and who was now based at an important research laboratory far, far away. The professor suggested to Gertrude that she'd get her laptop and look up his website, where she would find an essay subtitled paupers drool a quack potion and no substitute for rational explanation when emboldening tiny ones terrified by electrical storms.

Unknown Speaker  23:33
Twilight descended with no let up in the ferocious Tempest. The prince pranced into the playroom bearing a tray on which was at a brightly gleaming goblet, containing a tincture of paupers drool next to which lay some scraps of bandage pressed into service as pads with which to dab the tincture onto the forehead of the terrified quaking, Infanta behind the heiress. Yet she was gone. At midnight to the prince found his daughter at last, she was skipping, laughing, gambling and giggling in the open fields behind the palace as thumbed about crashed and lightning raked to the heavens. And so never again did the Infanta Gertrude cower behind an heiress during a thunderstorm. Never again we're odo and Udo sent off with their iron pails to collect the drool of porpoise, and never again did the prince believer word he heard from the wise woman of the weird woods of wubi who be who, who was in any case, too busy with her team of pigs to twitch the prancing Prince from the crumbling Palace in the faraway land of Gar.

Unknown Speaker  25:19
Tom, I think the one more story this week this is called cake and pastry person. Many many years ago so long ago that you were probably not yet born. There was a cake and pastry person who drove a van around Pang Hill and blister lane, tooting our horn in the summer afternoons, for it seemed the sun was always shining in those faraway days. Those were times when children still bought cakes and pastries from a van. A big pantechnicon painted yellow and red and pink and moving black. It was also of course, the time when people worship the hideous back God fatso, and walk the earth in fear of his flapping wings and his shrill squeaking that turned up the innards and pierced the soul. Where in other lands, the roads would be lined by milestones, telling the distance to an important town or port. Here there were hundreds and hundreds of huge stone carvings of fatso, the visible reminder of his terrible and terribly haphazard power. Children were protected from the worst of his wrath. For facts over bat, God did not fully reveal himself until a person reached adulthood. For tinies the stone statues were simply part of the landscape like trees or kiosks or pneumatic power towers. Although the bat God is forgotten today, everyone remembers the resin hoops that were the favorite playthings of young and older like, I'm sure you know the words for that old song. We skip and frolic and Loop The Loops along Pang hill with our resin hoops. We skip and frolic on blister lane with our resin hoops we loop again. Sometimes children would play at tossing their hoops over a fat Oh statue, giving the bat God a necklace. Everyone knew that a hoops resin ones resting around the stone neck of the God would begin immediately to rot and that by the next morning, nothing would remain but a squelchy foul smelling string of glutinous goo, drippy, dripping onto the ground, where soon vile, prickly poisonous weeds would sprout. These were the roads up and down which the cake and pastry person's van would trundle slowing to a halt whenever a little crowd of tinies gathered each child clutching a cake and pastry token. In an excited a gaggle, the children would exchange their tokens for cakes and pastries. And the cake and pastry person would collect the tokens in his token tin, which rattled when he shook it and shake it he did to hear that pleasing rattle. He beamed at the children as he handed out his cakes and pastries and took their tokens and rattled his token tin. But an acute observer might see that the beam was a false Rictus grin for the cake and pastry person was plunged in melancholy.

Unknown Speaker  28:21
He remembered the innocent times when he too, had been able to eat cakes and pastries without a care. Now like every adult in the land, his days were consumed by a desperate need to placate fat so they're hideous bad God. It seemed that fatso needed more and more tokens every day, and the cake and pastry person was seldom satisfied until his 10 was so crammed with tokens that it no longer rattled. Only then could he sees driving his pan technic on round and round the roads and park by the perimeter fence of the swan sanctuary and take your tin on foot along the lines of fat souls cave and wait with all the other supplicants for night to fall and for the bat God's lieutenants to Shema interview. When it last his turn came, he would empty the tin into the outstretched paws were greedy and grasping Lieutenant and plead for benediction. But benediction rarely came tomorrow, a bigger 10 more tokens. That's what he commanded in the horrible high pitched squeals of fat toes in human mermaid arms. One by one then they would flit away with their booty into the deepest, darkest recesses of the cave, and the cake and pastry person and all the other 100 and sorry, believers would traipse away back to their huts and shacks and cabins and try to snatch a few brief hours sleep before dawn broke and they faced a new day with redoubled effort. As they slept, the resin hoops rotted on the statues of their bat God. poisonous weeds crept and cold along the ground. In the nurseries and the cover of the night, tiny children giggled with delight happy that they had bolstered fat SOS power for another day. Sure in the knowledge that tomorrow would bring more looping the loop with their resin hoops, more sunshine, and more cakes and pastries from the cake and pastry persons yellow and red and pink and move and black cake and pastry van. That's all we have time for this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I'll be back next week. Yeah, I am the Bishop of Suffolk and this is what I do.
