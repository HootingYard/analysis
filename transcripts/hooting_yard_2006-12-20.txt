Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank Kate and this is hooting yard on the air. Christmas is coming up, of course, and there's been a lot of talk of not you know, making sure that it's all inclusive and not offending anyone as if, God forbid anyone should be offended by anything ever. And so people get very sensitive about the Christian nature of Christmas and not wanting to upset Muslims and Jews and Sikhs and anyone else. But so being sourly, woolly liberal, guilt ridden people here hooting yard, I thought I'd celebrate Christmas with a song a sacred song. From yet another religious tradition. This is taken from the Rig Veda americanas sacred songs of the ancient Mexicans for all those Aztec fundamentalists out there. And that it's from volume in Britain's library of Aboriginal American literature, edited by dg Brinton, published in 1990. And very good at is to I don't know the title of this piece. It's a war song, which is possibly not appropriate for Christmas, but never mind. We're inclusive here. The war song of the Wits now whack, and it goes like this. What how my work is in the hall of arms, I listened to no mortal nor can any put me to shame. I know none such I am of a terror. I know none other. I am where war is. My work is said to be in the whole of arms. Let no one curse my children. adornment comes from the south. It is varied in color as the clothing of the eagle. Whoa, whoa. abundance of youths doubly closed. arrayed in feathers are my captives. I deliver them up I deliver them up. My captives are right in feathers. Oh youths feather with snap whack, arrayed in feathers. These are my captives. I deliver them up. I deliver them up arrayed in feathers, my captives. Youth from the south are riding feathers, my captives, I deliver them up, I deliver them up arrayed in feathers, my captives. The gold enters the Whitson, our HVAC, he descends as an example, He shines forth, He shines forth, descending as an example. A don't like us, he enters as a God. He descends as an example. He shines forth He shines forth, descending as an example. And an adaptation of that song, with slightly amended words, is what sailed to the tune of carry on wayward son by stadium rockers Kansas, and it's been heard around hooting yard every day for the past couple of months. Ever since pansy cradle, Drew became an adept of goon Fang, often confused with the traditional martial arts of the East. goon Fang is, as David Bowie once said, so regrettably, a completely different kettle of press on. I asked pansy to explain to readers what it means to be an adept of this ancient mystic art. And she scribbled a few words on the discarded wrapper of a toffee apple, which I'll read out now. It is not without reason that goon Fang is shrouded in mystery. For when the powers of both goon and Fang are combined. The adept enters the plane of the eek, a state of being both terrifying and a bit frightening. If I tell you anything more, my goon energy will be dissipated, and my Fang plasma will curdle. The plasma is of course invisible and mighty, but should it curdle, the very stars in their heavens will explode. So I'm keeping mum for the time being

a seasonal story now. This is Cold in the bleak mid winter. I know it's not mid winter, but it's pretty bleak. In the bleak mid winter, frosty wind made mon, but that was outside in the vast harrowing wilderness of wind and ice and storm and horror. Whereas we were snuck inside in the lecture tent, camping in our hands piping hot mugs of a strange Norwegian soup, peering through the steam towards the platform upon which to the lectern awaiting a lecturer. There was as you can imagine, typical lecture 10, hubbub. But then suddenly he was there at the lectern, smashing his fist on it, startling us all. So the hubbub was hushed in an instant, and he began to speak. valves, flaps, funnels, ducts, dials, plungers and hundreds upon hundreds of nozzles. My name is Serge. He then gathered up a sheaf of papers from the lectern and left the platform disappearing behind the curtain of motive and sarees brocade. And we were forced to conclude that the evening's lecture was at an end. Now this was something of a quandary. It was early evening out in the trackless icy wastes, and we were as a loose end, it may have been worth pursuing surge, of course, if I need a pump him for the precise meaning of what had seemed to be very well chosen words, which valves did he mean? What flaps and so on and so forth. l who go vamp my companion was pessimistic However, she said she knew his type, and he would be forever on forthcoming. I pondered what type surge was, and how el lugar vamp knew enough of them to make so sweeping a judgment. Before I could quit her to this effect, there was an anon adorably hideous, inhuman, eerie, blood curdling eldritch awful howling from outside owl who gauvin stopped up her ears with cotton wool, and continue to smoke her accurate Serbian cigarillo looking quite plussed nonchalant, unlike me, for I was nonplussed and chalant and innocent of cotton wool is stoppers. A waiting page person stepped to my side to take my drained soup mug, and I asked him what was the cause of a howling? He said nothing in reply, merely exchanging sidelong glances with L who go vamp, who I am sure nodded in response to his imperceptibly raised eyebrow. The next thing I knew he had taken me forcibly by the arm, stared me out of the tent, plopped me numb to gently onto a sledge, boarded it himself, and mushed a team of Huskies, who sped us across the ice at bewildering speed. The howling had not been Husky howling of that I was convinced, for I have made a thorough study of the howlings of all known hounds, and of certain other howling creatures, which are not hounds such as monkeys. But the fact that my question remained unanswered, was a little concerned to me now, as I hang on to the wooden safety rails of the sledge fearful that if I lost my grip, I would topple off onto the ice or snow, or whatever impossibly white stuff it was we were streaking across, glistening under the moonlight. David Bowie would once have dubbed it serious moonlight, and not without reason. I do not think I've ever been in a more serious frame of mind than I was then. 1000 questions jumbled in my brain? The only one I can recall all these years later was did they put something in the soup? It was a good question, actually. Later, when I was sitting opposite surge in a sort of giant bamboo and straw pod that might have been constructed from half a dozen balloon baskets. I asked him about the soup. His reply was fascinating, lengthy, but absolutely fascinating. Among the points I managed to drop down with my dropping, stabbing my daughter with a following

Frank Key  09:31
one, as I had surmised, the soup was strange and Norwegian to the recipe had been discovered in a manuscript entitled some strange Norwegian soup recipes copied by hand from ancient in canavalia. Three alhuda vamp had sprinkled something into the soup as it simmered on the stoves at the back of the tent. For he surge was better spent Draw being who had been sent to impart an important message to the world, and I was to be the recipient of that message. Five. Well, having said that, either me or somebody else whose identity he could not divulge. Once he had ceased his babbling, I shifted on easily on my shows long and fixed him with what I hoped was a steely glare. This was completely wasted, for I later learned that Serge was as blind as a blanket. He extrude the use of a guide dog because being spectral he had no need for Earth bound the systems having not knowingly met and the theory or being before I felt rather shy, and flapped my hands around awkwardly. One of my shoelaces had come on down on the high speed skim across the wasteland, two surgeries pod. I became conscious that there were bits of steamed greens from the soup in my beard. Serge was saying nothing more for the time being. We sat in silence for some time. I could not help pondering on el lugar vamps perfidy, if perfectly it was. I had not known her for long, but would not have thought her capable of stooping so low as to poison a strange Norwegian soup. And not just my mug, but the cauldron fall. I wondered about the others in the lecture tent audience, some of whom I counted as friends. Little Tim, the meteorology student, Sasha the ruthian constants crew fads, the transcriber of witterings by Yoko Ono, with a and others now beyond help their digestive systems shutting down as l who go vamps mysterious soup sprinkling ravaged their innards. I was seized with a desperate need to return to the tent, however perilous the journey may be, and stood up suddenly gesticulating like a maniac at surge, who blind though he was regarded me with amusement. It was at this point that a pair of ostriches came thudding and scampering into the pod. At least I think they were ostriches. You can never be sure, particularly if like me, you have not accorded a bird life the same painstaking attention as you have hounds. And I grant that I have not done so. No, never, never, never. And I regret that now. Serge greeted the ostriches if that is what they were, with a curiously unnerving whoop. unnerving because it sounded exactly and I mean, exactly like l who go vamps laughter, a sound I knew well, and would never hear again without shuttering. How convenient if I could say that I swooned and recalled nothing more. But I remember those next two minutes with a grim clarity. There is a line in one of Dennis bear pints poems that goes then the ostriches revealed themselves as emissaries from something something and all was magnesium white, and something that pretty much sums up how it was. I often wonder how beer pints that puny versified somehow managed to foretell what happened to me that night in an otherwise irrelevant piece of concrete drivel. One of the ostriches gave me the one cyber untold surge he had picked the wrong person 2.5 above their pod would have to be released from its restraining wires and be transported. I knew not how to the perimeter of a holiday camp near Basingstoke, where the true and it was hinted more worthy. recipient of surgeries otherworldly message was awaiting them. I had time to tie my shoelace before I was bundled out of the pod and abandoned.

I hailed the passing motorized snowplow, which took me back to the lecture tent. Everyone was still there, looking none the worse for wear. animatedly discussing valves and flaps and funnels and dials and duct and plungers and hundreds upon hundreds of nozzles. The consensus was that surge had been the most charismatic lecturer of the winter. Through a fog of pipe smoke. I sought out alhuda vamp and found her lounging in a nook, her eyes flashing brilliantly and laughing her head off and I shouted

As I said, Christmas is coming. So here's his. Here's a seasonal Christmas piece. It doesn't mention David Bowie, which much to my horror both of the previous pieces have. I should point out for listeners who are interested in these things that the piece I'm going to read next is taken from the forthcoming imminently forthcoming hooting yard and solidary print and solitary a paperback book, entitled befuddled by cormorants, 52 stories. And the book gathers together 52 stories, one for every week of next year, from two and a half years of hosting out on the air radio shows. So isn't that something exciting to look forward to? Unable to get out in time for Christmas, but it should be out very, very soon. If you want to know how to get hold of a copy, you can go to the hooting yard website and it's exciting new address which is www dot hooting yard one word.org o r g www dot hooting yahoo.org and details of the book will probably also be available on the resonance FM website and this is called Christmas dinner. Boiled cormorant Allah Dobson. This is a splendid and satisfying dish, easy to prepare highly nutritious and the enemy of indigestion. First ensure your kitchen is free of ominous creeping things with hundreds of legs, suckers and anti root them out and exterminate them. Gather the tiny corpses, place them in a paper bag, seal a bag with glue, carry it out of the house and set fire to it. Do not go back indoors until every last speck has been consumed by the terrible flames. Now, back in the kitchen, take off your wind treater and your big black boots and wash your hands with carbolic soap. Cover your hairstyle if you have one. With a clean rag fixed in place by an elastic band. You are ready to begin. Take a freshly slaughtered cormorant and place it on your work surface. vegetarians can substitute the bird with a pretend cormorant model in mazi pan I will not remind you of this point again. pluck all the feathers often put them in a grinder grind them to find powder and using a funnel. pour the powder into a spare crew it if there is a ring around the cormorants neck as there will be if it has been exploited by fisherfolk. Carefully remove the ring and throw it away unless it is old and decorative, in which case you may wish to pop it in an envelope and send it to Antiques Roadshow veteran Hughes Scully, but do that later on Boxing Day. Step to boil the cormorant. While the bird is simmering away, prepare the source, trap up into tiny bits for pomegranates or plum, lots and lots of potatoes 16 bananas, another cormorant, some toffee apples and a choc ice. Place the tiny bits in a bowl and stir thoroughly. Then get the funnel again and pour the contents of the bowl into the grinder. Adjust the setting to moderately violent grinding and switch it on for no more than 10 seconds. Transfer back into the bowl. Add water up to the brim and stir. Do not on any account use tap water. You will ruin the recipe and end up with a bowl of inedible sludge unless you use the fantastically pure spring water drawn from the mysterious old well at the pointy town. drain any remaining water from the pan with the boiled cormorant in it and tip the contents of the bowl in making sure you do so in one swift movement. Ideally, it should sound like this gloup gloup gloup gloup Now, put the bowl down somewhere bring the pan back to the boil and allow to simmer while you fry the cocktail sausages. They should be almost but not quite black.

You're nearly done. Take a large oval platter and make a bed of shredded lettuce tribe Spring onions, porridge oats, cream crackers and mayonnaise. have another look around the kitchen to make sure no creepy crawlies have appeared from any unhatched eggs you may have overlooked earlier. Turn off the heat and transfer the boiled cormorants and sauce onto the platter. Use a clean dish cloth to wipe around the edges in case any of the sources dribbling over the side. Take a Swiss Army knife out of your pocket, extract the sharpest blade and just in case the last time you used it was to dislodge your pebble from the soul of your boot. plunge it into boiling water to sterilize it. Very carefully slice the blade across the cormorant as deep as you can and put the knife down. Insert the cocktail sausages into the bird. Then sew up the slit with edible Butcher's string. Try to remember where you left the spec crew it and sprinkle the powdered cormoran feathers evenly over the dish. Add salt and pepper to taste serve.

It has to be said that most of the inhabitants of uhlans Wharf are not worth writing about. There they are with few exceptions a gray and insipid bunch. One of those exceptions, however, is the pedant from whose pen streams a series of Riker's nostrums or possibly nostre regularly sent out into the world, or at least into this bilgewater befouled corner of it. posters. They are on a notice board outside the pet shop, from which they are rapidly torn down and stuffed into the pockets of those citizens who collect them with something approaching mania. Three questions present themselves to the inquiring mind. Who is this pedant? What are his nostrums and are they righteous? I do not have an enquiring mind, at least not today, for I'm too busy putting the finishing touches to my taxonomy of swans in tin wood grease and sand and imposing sculpture which has not yet found a buyer and may therefore remain wedged in my bathroom for years to come. But I know that listeners will be curious about the pendant and his nostrums and their righteousness. So I asked Dr. Ruth pastry to investigate. Now Dr. pastry and I have a somewhat fraught relationship. many moons ago, we got into an argument about that anonymous 18th century suicide note which reads in its entirety, all this buttoning and unbuttoning. I cannot recall the substance of our dispute. Only that harsh and unforgiveable words were exchanged. saucepans hurled one still brim full of an appetizing soup, and threats leveled against pets, to wit, a tortoise and a goose. The tortoise was mine, the goose Dr. pastries. In the end, neither of them came to any harm, at least not immediately. Although of course, the ravages of the passing years took their toll, and both of them are now dead and gone. Diego the tortoise in a Maelstrom and wrecks the goose in a railway accident. very much alive though, is the feud between me and Dr. pastry, and it was with a view to ending it that I invited her help with the pedant in his righteous nostrums. It was the sort of assignment I thought she would enjoy, given her fondness for both patents and nostrums. I was wrong. Here is what she wrote in reply to my invitation. For the love of heaven key, what makes you think for one moment that I would ever again set foot in that confounded Siegert wasteland. The last time I went to Oh, hooligans Wharf. I was young, cheery and full of beans, or blue stocking with a glint of glory in my bright blue eyes. Two hours of after cycling into town with a pannier full of Proust, I was sprawled on a heap of pebbles stinking of the sea, a prematurely age drudge with knots in my hair pustules on my brow and a belly full of 90% proof eggnog. Don't get me wrong. I don't blame the shriveled and witless Oh hooligans, war fights. It's simply the spirit of the place. It does that to a person, even to me. Well, never again. Your patent with his nostrums can go hang. I am going out to the cemetery now to place a bunch of peonies and flax on Paul Rex's tomb. And as I do so, I will curse you again and again, as I have cursed you every single day since the buttoning and unbuttoning business first flared adya clearly, if I was going to satisfy my listeners curiosity about the patterns and his nostrums and their righteousness, I would have to think again, Dr. pastry scene didn't know me to make peace, and I was not sure I would be able to change her mind. All of which I suppose goes to explain why I found myself hopelessly lost in the dark dark woods as midnight struck. With Dr. pastry down the pan as it were, I worked desalt orally as midnight struck. At the sorry, with Dr. pastry down the pan as it were,

I worked desalt orally at the taxonomy of swans, my mind buzzing away trying to think of someone else who might be able to help. As I tamped A Fistful of grease into a knothole I suddenly remember the old blind woodcutter. It was true that he knew nothing about hoons Wharf, but I reasoned that might work to my advantage. dipping my hands into a tub of swore fieger, I tried to recall his metal Tapping Machine registry number. He had made me swear never to write it down. And I had honored my promise, partly out of rectitude, and partly because he said that if I broke my word, he would send a sloth of slow lumbering bears to smother me in my bed. His sightless eyes gleamed dangerously in the candlelighters he said this, and I realized that the story about how old mar bagshawe met her and suddenly made sense. My Word is my bond on mumbled, and the old blind woodcutter cackled. Now, though, 20 years later, with the Soviet Union long collapsed, I simply could not remember that damn number, I realized I would have to set off into the dark dark woods and find the old blind wood cutters crumbling cottage and ask him face to face. I tacked the end of a length of string to my gait and paid it out behind me as I walked each step taking me further and further from the comforts of home and the unfinished taxonomy of swans and closer to the perils of the dark woods. Had I known that my neighbor's Eagle Simon had swooped out of the sky within minutes of my departure, and bitten the end of the string, because it smelled of hamster I would have stopped then and there. In my ignorance, of course, I tramped on little knowing that like the answers my friend, my string, the string that should see me safely home was blowing in the wind. And the answers to my three questions about the pedant of Oh hooligans Wharf, and his nostrums and the righteousness of his nostrums. They too are blowing in the wind, for what hope do I have of discovering them now in this Stygian darkness, it is midnight, I am encircled by enormous trees that Duff underfoot is musty and damp and alive with tiny biting creatures. There is no trace of the old blind wood cutters cottage. Perhaps I only ever imagined him. My hand still stink of small finger. It is midnight and pitch black, and I have been wandering these dark dark woods for 100 years.

Luckily, you don't have 100 years to wait for the next episode of hooting yard on the air, which I think should be back next Wednesday, two days after Christmas 27th of December, same time, same place as ever. And I may have further news for you then of befuddled by coumarins. But until then, I hope you've enjoyed the show and have a good week. Bye bye
